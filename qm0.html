<h1 id="header">Understanding Position in Entry-Level Quantum Mechanics<br/></h1>

<div id="intro"> 

<p>Quantum mechanics is weird. In Schr&ouml;dinger's model
  for particle mechanics, our classical position function $x(t)$ is replaced with
  a statistical object that we call the wavefunction $ \Psi(x,t)$. 
  Let us motivate a study into quantum mechanics by showcasing a
  <b>directly-observable</b> consequence of the wavefunction $\Psi$.
Classical and quantum mechanical motion for a particle differ as such:</p>  
<!--Later, we will return to closely
examine $\Psi$ and its perplexing properties from the beginning.
Consider this page a motivating preface to a volume on early Quantum Particle Mechanics.
</p>-->

<ul id="introlist"><li><b>In Classical Mechanics</b>: <i>all information about a system is encoded 
  in its position function $x(t)$. Solves a second-order <u>ordinary</u> differentail equation</i>.</li>
<li><b>In Schr&ouml;dinger's Quantum Mechanics</b>: <i>information about system energy is encoded 
  instead in the wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$. Solves a linear <u>partial</u> differential equation</i>.</li></ul>
<hr/><h3 id="section">Motion in Newtonian Mechanics</h3>

<p>To understand how $\Psi(x,t)$ provides any system information, we need to first explore how information
  is encoded in a classical system. In Newton's formulation, recall that a particle's 
  position over time is the solution set $x(t)$ to the differential equation:
</p>
<p>$$ \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black] {\vec{F}=m \ddot{x} = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}} \tag{Eq. 1}$$ 
</p>
<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 1</b> - Newton's equation of motion says that acceleration is the second
time-derivative of the position vector $x$.</p>
<p>Solutions to (Eq. 1) provide deterministic solution set for the system's motion over all time and space. Of course, for real
  systems our $F$ probably does not have an analytical form for us to make such complete deductions as we can in theory.
</p>

<hr/><h3>Motion and Energy in Schr&ouml;dinger's Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger's analog to Newton's Equation is a complex-valued energy conservation equation:</p>

$$
\bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{
  i \hbar \frac{\partial{\Psi(x,t)}}{\partial{t}} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t) \Psi(x,t)
} \tag{Eq. 2}
$$
<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 2</b> - Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation for the energy and motion of a particle. Partial differential equation whose solutions are functions of both position and time: $\Psi(x,t)$. $\Psi^*$ denotes the complex conjugate of $\Psi$
    to account for complex-valuec wavefunctions. More on that later.</p>

<p>Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation (Eq. 2) is a linear second-order partial differential equation, and has the form of 
  a wave equation. Obtaining analytical solutions to this PDE for a given system potential $V$ is almost never trivial, and sometimes it is impossible.
</p>
<hr/><h3 id="secheader">Where is Classical Position Encoded in Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation?</h3>

<p>Undoubtably, as bizarre as (Eq. 2) is in comparison to Newton's Equation, they <u>must</u> agree 
in the classical limits of our system. If Classical Mechanics can accurately predict 
behaviors for a variety of systems, then those classical solutions should appear 
in our quantum mathematical models as well.
<ul id="introlist"><li>In other words, we need to verify that Classical Mechanics 
  actually <i>is</i> an approximation for Qunantum Mechanics.</li>
</ul></p>



<p>Schr&ouml;dinger's partial differential equation for energy conservation
  has solutions not of $x(t)$, but of $\Psi(x,t)$, which are related to $x(t)$ 
  statistically as an expectation value:
</p>
<span>
  $$
  \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{ \lt x(t) \gt = \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} \left[\Psi\ x\ \Psi^* \right]\ dx} \tag{Eq. 3}$$ 
</span>

<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 3</b> - Expectation value for position as a function of time 
  according to Schr&ouml;dinger, given by $\Psi(x,t)$. Here, $\Psi^*(x,t)$ denotes the complex conjugate of $\Psi(x,t)$.</p>
<p>In Quantum Mechanics, $ \hat{x}$ 
  is known as an operator ($\hat{x}$ is the operator for position). Operators are how we obtain
  observable quantities in Quantum Mechanics, since $\Psi(x,t)$ itself is not observable. 
  
  <ul><li>This is a bizarre way of describing a system's motion; it is highly indirect in comparison to Classical Mechanics,
which has solutions to its diff. eq. that are directly observable $x(t)$.</li> 
<li>Here, $\lt x(t) \gt$ is the probability of finding our particle between $- \infty$ and $+ \infty$ (all of space, like $x(t)$ in classical mechanics).</li></ul></p>
