<h1 id="header">Understanding Position in Entry-Level Quantum Mechanics</h1>

<div id="intro"> 

<p>Quantum mechanics is weird. In Schr&ouml;dinger's model
  for energy conservation, our position function of time $x(t)$ is replaced with
  a mathematical object we call the wavefunction $ \Psi(x,t)$. Why is this weird in comparison to classical mechanics? 
</p>

<ul id="introlist"><li>In classical mechanics: all information about a particle system is encoded 
  in the position function $x(t)$.</li>
<li>In Schr&ouml;dinger's quantum mechanics: information about the system is encoded instead in the wavefunction $\psi(x,t)$</li></ul>

<p>Why are we shifting our focus from $x(t) \rightarrow \Psi(x,t)$? Mathematically,
  where does this new function emerge from?
</p>

<p>To understand the origin of $\Psi(x,t)$, we need to first understand how information
  is encoded in a classical system. In Newton's Classical Mechanics, a particle's 
  position over time - $x(t)$ - is the solution set for $x(t)$ in Newton's differential equation for motion:
</p>
<p>$$ \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black] {F=m \ddot{x} = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}} \tag{Eq. 1}$$ 
</p>
<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 1</b> - Newton's equation of motion says that acceleration is the second
time-derivative of the position vector $x$. This is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation.</p>
<p>Solutions to Newton's Equation (Eq. 1) leads to a deterministic understanding of the system's motion.
  Together with energy conservation, this leads to anything we would want to know about a system's behavior.
</p>

<p>Schr&ouml;dinger's equivalent to Newton's Equation is a complex-valued energy conservation equation:</p>

$$
\bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{
  i \hbar \frac{\partial{\Psi(x,t)}}{\partial{t}} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t) \Psi(x,t)
} \tag{Eq. 2}
$$
<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 2</b> - Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation for the energy and motion of a particle. Partial differential equation whose solutions are functions of both position and time: $\Psi(x,t)$.
  according to Schr&ouml;dinger, given by $\Psi(x,t)$. Here, $\Psi^*(x,t)$ denotes the complex conjugate of $\Psi(x,t)$.</p>

<p>The partial differential equation for motion (Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation)
  has solutions not of $x(t)$, but of $\Psi(x,t)$, which are related to $x(t)$ statistically
  as an expectation value:
</p>
<span>
  $$
  \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{< x(t) >\ = \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} \left[\Psi\ x\ \Psi^* \right] dx} \tag{Eq. 3}$$ 
</span>

<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 3</b> - Expectation value for position as a function of time 
  according to Schr&ouml;dinger, given by $\Psi(x,t)$. Here, $\Psi^*(x,t)$ denotes the complex conjugate of $\Psi(x,t)$.</p>
<p>In Quantum Mechanics, $ \hat{x}$ 
  is known as an operator ($\hat{x}$ is the operator for position). Operators are how we obtain
  observable quantities in Quantum Mechanics, since $\Psi$ itself is not observable.</p>
