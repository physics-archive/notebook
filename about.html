<h1 style="text-align:center;">About Me</h1>
  <p>Under development. Copy of my README.md: </p>

  <p>Content studied while obtaining my BS in Physics, rewritten and expanded. 
    Coded in HTML and CSS with MathJax.js.
    Purpose: to host "open-source" notes for undergraduate physics material.

  </p>


  <p>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: None of the content hosted on my git is direct source material 
    from the University of Connecticut. UConn educated me, but this project is conscientious of the following:

  </p>

  <ul id="listonabout"><li>
    Never to re-use any graphics or code provided to me by the University of Connecticut.
  </li>

<li>Never to include scanned notes from any professors whose classes I took, or was granted private access to.

</li>

<li><b>NEVER will this repo host any exam-related material. 
  This is the one area that is entirely non-grey and is punishable by UConn.</b>
  <br/><br/>Of course, some staple problems I cover do appear on Physics exams; 
  generalized prolems such as QHO, the Basel Problem, Hydrogen fine-structure energy corrections, etc.,
  are not intellectual property of the University and are available publically.

<br/><br/>Widely-accepted mathematical models for physical systems will always 
overlap with course material. My bases are covered by not referencing solutions that come from exams or privated problem sets.
<br/><br/>My only exception to date is content from a course that one of my professors hosts publicly. 
A public-domain approach to the distribution of educational material is partially why this project is being written.


</li>

<li>Problem sets are generally off limits for me taking problems or solutions from, 
  regardless of the fact that they would be re-transcribed by me.

</li>
