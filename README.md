# Digital-Physics-Archive
Content studied while obtaining my BS program in Physics, rewritten and expanded. Coded in HTML and CSS with MathJax.js from the ground-up. Purpose: to sharpen my coding skills while providing "open-source" e-textbook for undergraduate physics material.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: None of the content hosted on my git is actual source material from University of Connecticut. 
Many approaches were taught to me at UConn, but I carefully remain conscientious of the following:
  1) I never re-use any graphics provided to me by the University.
  
  2) No code or scanned-notes from any professors at the University.
     i) Likewise, I deliberately avoid rewriting anything that may have been recorded verbatim--
        despite the source notes existing in my own notebooks, transcribed in my own handwriting.
  
  4) NEVER will this repo hist any uploads of any exam-related material.
     This is the one area that is entirely non-grey and is punishable by the University.

  5) Problem sets are also off limits for me taking problems / solutions from,
     regardless of the fact that they would be re-transcribed.
     This would be problematic for standard course content at UConn like Griffiths.
