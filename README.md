# Digital-Physics-Archive
Content studied while obtaining my BS program in Physics, rewritten and expanded. Coded in HTML and CSS with MathJax.js from the ground-up. Purpose: to sharpen my coding skills while providing "open-source" e-textbook for undergraduate physics material.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: None of the content hosted on my git is direct source material from the University of Connecticut. 
UConn educated me, but I carefully remain conscientious of the following:
  1) I never re-use any graphics or code provided to me by the University.
  
  2) No scanned notes from any professors at the University are transcribed or included for viewing.
     i) Likewise, I deliberately avoid rewriting anything that may have been recorded verbatim from 2017-21 --
        despite the source notes existing in my own notebooks, transcribed in my own handwriting.
  
  4) NEVER will this repo host any uploads of any exam-related material.
     This is the one area that is entirely non-grey and is punishable by the University.
     Of course, some staple problems (like the QM infinite square well) do appear on Physics exams.
     Generalized prolems like that are not intellectual property of the University and are available publically without contest.
     

  6) Problem sets are also off limits for me taking problems / solutions from,
     regardless of the fact that they would be re-transcribed.
     This would be problematic for standard course content at UConn like Griffiths.
