# Digital-Physics-Archive
Content studied while obtaining my BS program in Physics, rewritten and expanded. Coded in HTML and CSS with MathJax.js from the ground-up. Purpose: to sharpen my coding skills while providing "open-source" e-textbook for undergraduate physics material.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: None of the content hosted on my git is direct source material from the University of Connecticut. 
UConn educated me, but I carefully remain conscientious of the following:
  1) I never re-use any graphics or code provided to me by the University.
  
  2) No scanned notes from any professors at the University are transcribed or included for viewing.

      Likewise, I deliberately avoid rewriting anything that may have been recorded verbatim from 2017-21 --
        despite the source notes existing in my own notebooks, transcribed in my own handwriting.
  
  
  3) NEVER will this repo host any uploads of any exam-related material.
     This is the one area that is entirely non-grey and is punishable by the University.
     Of course, some staple problems I cover do appear on Physics exams (like the infinite square well in early QM courses).

     Generalized prolems such as QHO, the Basel Problem, Schr√∂dinger's eq. for a free-particle, Hydrogen fine-structure energy corrections, are not intellectual property of the University and are available publically without contest.
     Widely-accepted mathematical models for physical systems will always overlap with course material.
     

  6) Problem sets are also off limits for me taking problems / solutions from,
     regardless of the fact that they would be re-transcribed.
     This would be problematic for standard course content at UConn like Griffiths.

     My only exception to date is content from a course that one of my professor's hosts publicly.
     His public-domain approach to the distribution of course material is partially responsible for this project being written.
