# Digital-Physics-Archive
Content studied while obtaining my BS in Physics. Coded in HTML and CSS with MathJax.js.

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: None of the content hosted on my git is direct source material from the University of Connecticut. 
UConn educated me, but this project is conscientious of the following:
  1) Never to re-use any graphics or code provided to me by the University of Connecticut. 
  
  2) Never to include scanned notes from any professors in my program.

      Likewise, I deliberately avoid adding anything from my own notes that may have been recorded verbatim from 2017-21. All material is sourced from my handwritten notebooks, or textbooks (with APA formatting).
  
  
  3) NEVER will this repo host any exam-related material. Period. This is the one area that is entirely non-grey and is punishable by UConn.

     Of course, some staple problems I cover do appear on physics exams. Generalized prolems such as QHO, the Basel Problem, Hydrogen fine-structure energy corrections, etc., are not intellectual property of the University and are available publically.
   
     Mathematical models for physical systems will always overlap with course material. My bases are covered by not referencing solutions that came from any exams or privated problem-sets.
     

  6) Problem sets are generally off limits for me taking problems / solutions from,
     regardless of the fact that they would have been re-transcribed twice by me.
     This would be problematic for standard course content at UConn, such as courses that read Griffiths EM or QM.

     My only exception to date is content from a course that one of my professor's hosts publicly.
     His public-domain approach to the distribution of course material is partially responsible for this project being written.
