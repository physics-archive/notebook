<p>
  This research was conducted in 2021 for UConn's Department of Physics, and was intended by Dr. Ilya Sochnikov as a follow-up
  to a 2019 paper co-authored by himself and a previous student, Jonah Cerbin: 
  <a class="citation" href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-lookup/doi/10.1063/1.5112088" target="blank">
    <i>Isolation solution for extreme environmental vibrations for quantum-enabling cryogenic setups installed on raised frames</i>. </a>
  

    <br/><br/>
    My research would not have been possible without Mr. Cerbin and Dr. Sochnikov's detailed investigation, nor without Dr. Sochnikov's laboratory resources. 
    Supplementary resources to the 2019 paper were crucial when writing and reviewing my original MATLAB code during 2021.

      <hr/><h3 id="section">Introduction</h3>
      <p>This module will provide a ground-up demonstration of how signal analysis is performed, starting from the raw voltage inputs of a seismic accelerometer.
        In particular, a review of the following are necessary:
        <ul>
        <li>Mathematical methods: Fourier analysis, octave analysis, power spectrum density, and Fast Fourier Transforms</li>
        <li>Experimental Methods: Accelerometers, amplifiers and oscilloscopes</li>
        <li>MATLAB scripting: vectorization, nested for loops, and sorting</li>
      </ul>
    
    </p>

      <hr/><h3 id="section">Motivations</h3>
  
      <p>
        A set of Vibration Criteria (VC) are used to evaluate the magnitude of external vibrations within a sensitive research facility.  
        The vibration-sensitive instrument of focus is Bluefors' LD closed-cycle Dilution Refrigerator System.
        <br/><br/>
        Dilution refrigerators may achieve temperatures in the milikelvin-range (mK). Here,
        as quantum phenomena emerge, random movement of a system is generally unwanted. For dilution refrigerators, 
        significant vibrations may affect cooling cycle(s), and will inhibit any technology involved in measurement, 
        scanning, and imaging. 
        <br/><br/>
        Given the extreme conditions of these research spaces, it is adavantageous to at least characterize vibrations in the space, 
        even if one does not intend to implement any solutions to attenuate and reduce these vibrations.

      The following instruments were used to obtain raw, time-trace accelerometer data in Volts (V):

        <!-- <p>
          Signal analysis necessitates the use of computational methods for the following reasons: 
          <ul>
            <li>Signal analysis uses algorithms which are realistically performed only by machine. 
              A gold standard is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is used extensively in this research.</li>
            <li>Data sets tend to be very large in size, with thousands to millions of signals per array.</li>
        </ul>
          
          During data analysis, over 100,000 unique measurements were passed through the computational engine (a MATLAB script).
