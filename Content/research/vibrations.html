<p>
  This research was conducted in 2021 for UConn's Department of Physics, and was intended by Dr. Ilya Sochnikov as a follow-up
  to a 2019 paper co-authored by himself and a previous student, Jonah Cerbin: 
  <a class="citation" href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article-lookup/doi/10.1063/1.5112088" target="blank">
    <i>Isolation solution for extreme environmental vibrations for quantum-enabling cryogenic setups installed on raised frames</i>. </a>
  

    <br/><br/>
    My research would not have been possible without Mr. Cerbin and Dr. Sochnikov's detailed investigation, nor without Dr. Sochnikov's laboratory resources. 
    Supplementary resources to the 2019 paper were crucial when writing and reviewing my original MATLAB code during 2021.

      <hr/><h3 id="section">Introduction</h3>
      <p>This module will provide a ground-up demonstration of how signal analysis is performed, starting from the raw voltage inputs of a seismic accelerometer.
        A review of the following are necessary -- ordered from lowest-level to highest-level:
        <ul>
        <li>Mathematical methods: Fourier analysis, octave analysis, power spectrum density, and Fast Fourier Transforms</li>
        <li>Experimental Methods: Accelerometers, amplifiers and oscilloscopes</li>
        <li>MATLAB scripting: vectorization, nested for loops, and sorting</li>
      </ul>
    
    </p>

      <hr/><h3 id="section">Motivations</h3>
  
      <p>
        A set of Vibration Criteria (VC) are used to evaluate the magnitude of external vibrations within a sensitive research facility.  
        The vibration-sensitive instrument of focus is Bluefors' LD closed-cycle Dilution Refrigerator System.
        <br/><br/>
        Dilution refrigerators may achieve temperatures in the milikelvin-range (mK). Here,
        as quantum phenomena emerge, random movement of a system is generally unwanted. For dilution refrigerators, 
        significant vibrations may affect cooling cycle(s), and will inhibit any technology involved in measurement, 
        scanning, and imaging. 
        <br/><br/>
        Given the obligatory low-noise conditions of these research spaces, it is adavantageous to characterize vibrations in the space, 
        even if one does not intend to implement any solutions to attenuate and reduce vibrations.
    
      </p>

      <hr/><h3 id="section">Experimental Methods</h3>
      The following instruments were used to obtain raw, time-trace accelerometer data in Volts (V):

      <ul>
        <li>Wilcoxon 731a Ultra Low-Frequency Accelerometer
          <sup><a class="citation" href="../../Index/Research/vibrchr/731A-spec-98078E.2cc.pdf" target="blank">[1]</a></sup>
        </li> 
        
        <li>Wilcoxon P31 Ultra Low Noise Power Unit/Amplifier 
        <sup><a class="citation" href="../../Index/Research/vibrchr/P31_spec_98443J.1c.pdf" target="blank">[2]</a></sup>
      </li>
      
      <li>Owon VDS 1022 Oscilloscope for PC
        <sup><a class="citation" href="../../Index/Research/vibrchr/OWON-VDS.pdf" target="blank">[3]</a></sup>

      </li></ul>
      <p>
        Signals are detected by the the accelerometer's electrical components, passed through the amplifier to achieve gain, and then fed to the oscilloscope for recording. 
        Data are exported from the oscilloscope as time-trace voltages. The accelerometer's product manual provides the rates for converting voltage (V) to
       acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>).

     </p>
      <!-- <hr/><h3 id="section">Mathematical Methods: Spectral Analysis</h3> -->

      <hr/><h3 id="section">Math Methods I: Fourier Transforms</h3>
      Fourier transforms is the lowest-level concept to be covered in this module, 
      providing the fundamental algorithm(s) which enable signal analysis. For a deeper mathematical-approach,
      look into properties of unitary matrices, and singular value decomposition 
      (<a class="citation" href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.2991/978-94-6239-009-6" target="blank">Chui & Jiang, 2013, pg. 171</a>).
      </p>
      
      <p>These acceleration data are measured in the time domain, but meaningful signal analysis occurs when one decomposes the energy contributions at each component frequency.
        
      </p>

        <!-- <p>
          Signal analysis necessitates the use of computational methods for the following reasons: 
          <ul>
            <li>Signal analysis uses algorithms which are realistically performed only by machine. 
              A gold standard is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is used extensively in this research.</li>
            <li>Data sets tend to be very large in size, with thousands to millions of signals per array.</li>
        </ul>
          
          During data analysis, over 100,000 unique measurements were passed through the computational engine (a MATLAB script).
