<h2 style="text-align:center">Resolving Paradoxes in the Real Number Set $\Bbb{R}$</h2>


<p>Let us motivate some analysis of the real number line and its properties. In this section, I aim to demonstrate the following:</p>
<div id="transformation">
<ul id="introlist">
  <li>Set theory provides resolution to paradoxes in our real number system, such as infinities.</li>
    <li>Extending our number system from the naturals through to the reals ($\Bbb{N} \subseteq \Bbb{Z} \subseteq \Bbb{Q} \subseteq \Bbb{R}$) is required if 
      every length along the number line is to correspond to a value that we can actually define <span style="font-size:13pt">(Abbott, 2000 pg. 4)</span>.</li>
    <li>Functions may be generalized to a definition that is much less strict than what is covered prior to real analysis. This is instrumental in Physics, as it allows for numerical techniques (via computer) to be carried out when analytical solutions do not exist, which is often.</li>
</ul><!--Ends intro list-->

<hr/><h3>The Holes in our Rational Number Line</h3>
<p id="intro">Consider this bizarre function proposed by Dirichlet:</p>

<span>$$

f(x) = \begin{cases} 
1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \\
0\ \ \text{if} \ x \notin \Bbb{Q}

\end{cases} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</span> <!--Cases-->

<p>Plotting this function on the reals produces a figure that prompts discussion about 
  continuity. The plot conflicts with our limited definition of functions
 leading up to this point; it cannot be expressed as an algebraic relationship and seemingly pushes the borders of being single-valued.</p>

<div id="fig1">
<img src="..\MATLAB\dirichlety.png" height="210px" width="285px" />
</div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 1.</b> - A plot of f(x). This is a single function, coded numerically in MATLAB; this is not a plot of two functions stacked on top of one another.</span>
<p>Here are some important observations about $f(x)$:
<ul><li>The irrational number line (at $f(x)=0$) is constructed from the "holes" in the rational number line above it (at $f(x)=1$).
</li></ul>
<ul><li>This is a loose way of visualizing the property that elements of $\Bbb{Q}$ are dense in $\Bbb{R}$</li></ul>
<ul><li>Paradoxically, both sets of points consist of infinitely-many elements, no matter our scope along $\Bbb{R}$.
        
</li></ul>

</p>
<hr/><h3>Providing Visualization for $\Bbb{Q}$'s Unique Density in $\Bbb{R}$</h3>
<p>An interesting way to show that $\Bbb{Q}$ has density, as opposed to its subsets $\Bbb{N}$ and $\Bbb{Z}$,
  is to plot an analogue to Dirichlet's function, using the integers at $f(x)=1$ instead of the rationals. This time, the empty intervals between the upper set of points ($\Bbb{Z}$) 
  will be filled by the rationals of $\Bbb{Q}$ -- analogous to (Fig. 1) where the holes of $\Bbb{Q}$ were filled by the irrationals:</p>
  
  <span id="z">$$

    f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x) = \begin{cases} 
    1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Z} \\
    0\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \land x \notin \Bbb{Z}
    
    \end{cases} \tag{Eq. 2}$$</span>

<div id="fig2">
<img src="..\MATLAB\dirichletz.png" height="210px" width="285px" /></div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 2.</b> - A plot of $f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x)$ over a 
  domain that demonstrates how 
  empty intervals in $\Bbb{Z}$ are filled by densely-packed rationals. 
  Notice that irrationals are omitted in (Eq. 2) from the second piecewise condition, yet the number set at $f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x)=0$ still looks like a continuum; it is not a continuum as it is missing the irrationals.</span>

  <p>This property of $\Bbb{Q}$ to appear continuous, regardless of domain scope, is why the rational numbers form a field and support the identities for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
    For example, every element of $\Bbb{Z}$ has the multiplication inverses to support division. Still, we are missing many numbers in (Fig. 2) such as factors of $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$.
  </p>
<hr/><h3>Boundedness of our Number System</h3>

<p>
  <!--To proceed with mathenatical rigor, axiomic statements to 
  begin showing how rationals are packed together in the real number line $\Bbb{R}$. -->
  The common starting point for 
  characterizing our real number line is the <i>Axiom of Completeness</i> and a direct consequence -- the <i>Archimedean Property</i>.
These are leveraged to define infinities, boundedness, and dense sets.</p>

<ul id="axiom"><li><b>Axiom of Completeness</b>: <i>Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound</i> (Abbott, 2000, p.14).</li>
<li id="arch"><b>Archimedian Property (i):</b> <i>Given any number $x \in \Bbb{R}$, there exists an $n \in \Bbb{N}$ satisfying $n \gt x$</br></i></li>
<li id="arch"><b>Archimedian Property (ii):</b> <i>Given any number $y \in \Bbb{R}$, there exists an $n \in \Bbb{N}$ satisfying $1/n \lt y$</br></i> (Abbott, 2000, p.19)</li></ul>
</ul><!--<span id="fignotes">The AoC applies to sets bounded below as well, with greatest lower bounds.<br/></span>-->

<!--<span id="fignotes">These statements rely the fact that $\Bbb{N}$ is not bounded above.</span>-->

<p><br/>Starting with the <i>Axiom of Completeness</i>:
what does it mean for sets to be bounded, and how does this lead to resolution for paradoxes involving infinite sets?</p>

<span><ul><li>Provides a generalization for minima and maxima, applied directly to sets.</li>
<li>Consequently, 
  a rigorous definition for limits will eventually follow from this starting point. </li>
</ul> 
</span>
<hr/>
Going back and making some observations about our number system:

<ul id="observations">

  <li>The natural numbers set $\Bbb{N}$ leads with 1, so the natural set is bounded below (infinum of 1). It is <u>not</u> bounded above.
  Absence of an upper-bound fits historical notions of the infinite: the natural set begins but it never ends.</li>
  </ul>$$\Bbb{N} = \{1,2,3,4,\dots \}$$
  <ul id="observations"><li>The integer set $\Bbb{Z}$ is not bounded above, but unlike $\Bbb{N}$ the set is not bounded below. However, they are ordered and countably infinite, like the natural number set $\Bbb{N}$.</li>
  </ul>$$\Bbb{Z} = \{ \dots , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots \}$$
  <ul id="observations"><li>The rational field $\Bbb{Q}$ contains the set $\Bbb{Z}$. Therefore, $\Bbb{Q}$ will not be bounded below or above, yet it is still ordered and countably infinite.</li>
  </ul>$$\Bbb{Q} = \{ p/q : p \land q \in \Bbb{Z},\ q \notin 0 \}$$


<br/><div style="text-align:center;"><img id="setcenter" src="../Index/calc/trumpet/sets.png" alt="sets" width="150px" height="90px"/></div>
<span>Interestingly, it is clear that defining $\Bbb{Q}$ requires "more" notation; the Archimedean Property guarantees 
  that the rationals are packed "infinitesimally" close to one-another, based on the above definition. <br/><br/>Despite being countably infinite like the naturals and integers, it is tricker to list adjacent terms.<br/></span>

<hr/>
<p>Applying this concept elsewhere, consider some set $A$ with elements that are ordered as such:</p>

$$
A = \{r^2 \gt 2\ :\ x \in \Bbb{Q}\} \tag{Eq. 3}
$$

<p>Set $A$ contains all rational numbers $r^2$ that are greater than 2, not including 2 itself.</p> 
<ul><li>Rational numbers form an ordered set (field) that is countable, 
  and set <i>A</i> contains all rationals greater than 2</li>
<li>Therefore, set <i>A</i> is also ordered and countable; these properties are inherited from $\Bbb{Q}$.</li>
<li><i>A</i> must be <u>bounded below</u> with a <u>greatest lower bound</u> (infinum) of 2, despite $2 \notin A$.</li></ul>

$$ \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{ \text{inf} A=2} $$

<hr/>

<!--<p>This points towards the rational set being undoubtably "bigger" than the integer set. However, this is untrue. 
  Cardinality and equinumerosity give us the result that $\Bbb{Z}$ and $\Bbb{Q}$ actually have the same number of elements as each other and $\Bbb{N}$.</p>
<ul><li>In fact, it's even less intuitive. If |$\Bbb{Z}$| denotes the cardinatlity (# of elements) in the integer set $\Bbb{Z}$, 
  then it is fact that:</li></ul>

  <span>

    $$

    |\Bbb{N}|=|\Bbb{Z}|=|\Bbb{Q}|=\aleph_0 \tag{Eq. 3} $$
  </span>

  <span>Using real analysis, we can arrive at this conclusion by showing that each set can be bijectively mapped onto any of the three.
