<h2 style="text-align:center">Resolving Paradoxes in the Real Number Set $\Bbb{R}$</h2>


<p>Let us motivate some analysis of the real number line and its properties. In this section, I attempt to demonstrate the following:</p>
<div id="transformation">
<ul id="introlist">
  <li>Set theory provides resolution to paradoxes in our real number system, and allows us to define various number systems and operations with mathematical rigor.</li>
    <li>Extending our number system from the naturals through to the reals ($\Bbb{N} \subseteq \Bbb{Z} \subseteq \Bbb{Q} \subseteq \Bbb{R}$) is required if 
      every length along the number line is to correspond to a value that we can actually define <span style="font-size:13pt">(Abbott, 2000 pg. 4)</span>.
    This seems like a requirement of the standard model, where spacetime is treated asthis  continuous.
    <li>Functions may be generalized to a definition which is far less restrictive than the criteria proposed during 
      introductory courses in algebra and single-variable calculus. This is necessary when special functions (distributions) which appear in abundance in physics -- like Heaviside and Dirac-delta.
      <!--This is instrumental in Physics, as it allows for numerical techniques (via computer) to be carried out when analytical solutions do not exist, which is often.--></li>
</ul><!--Ends intro list-->

<hr/><h3>The Holes in our Rational Number Line</h3>
<p id="intro">Consider this bizarre function proposed by Dirichlet:</p>

<span>$$

f(x) = \begin{cases} 
1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \\
0\ \ \text{if} \ x \notin \Bbb{Q}

\end{cases} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</span> <!--Cases-->

<p>Plotting this function produces a figure that is highly discontinuous. As a result, f(x) pushes notions of being single-valued by appearing to produce two horizontal lines using inputs of <i>x</i>. 
<br/><br/>Resolution will not affect the plot's fine-structure or 'smoothness'. The <i>Archimedean Property</i>, held by rationals and reals, guarantees that there are infinite irrationals between any two elememts of $\Bbb{Q}$,
fitting this observation.</p>

<div id="fig1">
<img src="..\MATLAB\dirichlety.png" height="210px" width="285px" />
</div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 1.</b> - A plot of f(x). This is a single function, coded numerically in MATLAB; this is not a plot of two functions stacked on top of one another.</span>
<p>Here are some important observations about $f(x)$:
<ul><li>The irrational number line (situated at $f(x)=0$) is constructed from the "holes" in the rational number line above it (at $f(x)=1$).
</li></ul>
<ul><li>On a macroscopic scale, this demonstrates that elements of $\Bbb{Q}$ are dense in $\Bbb{R}$.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Paradoxically, both sets of points consist of infinitely-many elements.
    
</li></ul>

</p>

<p>This property of $\Bbb{Q}$ to appear continuous, regardless of domain scope, is why the rational numbers form a field and support the identities for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
  For example, every element of $\Bbb{Z}$ has the multiplication inverses to support division.
</p>

<hr/><h3>Providing Visualization for $\Bbb{Q}$'s Unique Density in $\Bbb{R}$</h3>
<p>An interesting way to show that $\Bbb{Q}$ has density, as opposed to its subsets $\Bbb{N}$ and $\Bbb{Z}$,
  is to plot an analogue to Dirichlet's function, but with integers at $f(x)=1$ and $x \in \Bbb{Q} \land x \notin \Bbb{Z}$ at f(x)=0. In this case, the empty intervals between the upper set of points ($\Bbb{Z}$) 
  will be filled by the rationals of $\Bbb{Q}$ -- analogous to (Fig. 1) where the holes of $\Bbb{Q}$ were filled by the irrationals:</p>
  
  <span id="z">$$

    f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x) = \begin{cases} 
    1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Z} \\
    0\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \land x \notin \Bbb{Z}
    
    \end{cases} \tag{Eq. 2}$$</span>

<div id="fig2">
<img src="..\MATLAB\dirichletz.png" height="210px" width="285px" /></div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 2.</b> - A plot of $f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x)$ over a 
  domain that demonstrates how 
  empty intervals in $\Bbb{Z}$ are filled by densely-packed rationals. 
   </span>
<p>Irrationals are absent from (Eq. 2), yet the set at $f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x)=0$ still looks continuous; 
  <!--It is missing all (infinite) irrational numbers, 
  and is missing fundamental numbers such as $\sqrt{2}$ and all factors of $\pi$.</p>-->
  
<hr/><h3>Boundedness of our Number System</h3>

<p>
  <!--To proceed with mathenatical rigor, axiomic statements to 
  begin showing how rationals are packed together in the real number line $\Bbb{R}$. -->
  A valid approach to begin 
  characterizing the real number line is invoking the <i>Axiom of Completeness</i> and the <i>Archimedean Property</i>.
These are leveraged to define infinities, boundedness, and dense sets.</p>

<ul id="axiom"><li><b>Axiom of Completeness</b>: <i>Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound</i> (Abbott, 2000, p.14).</li>
<li id="arch"><b>Archimedian Property (i):</b> <i>Given any number $x \in \Bbb{R}$, there exists an $n \in \Bbb{N}$ satisfying $n \gt x$</br></i></li>
<li id="arch"><b>Archimedian Property (ii):</b> <i>Given any number $y \in \Bbb{R}$, there exists an $n \in \Bbb{N}$ satisfying $1/n \lt y$</br></i> (Abbott, 2000, p.19)</li></ul>
</ul><!--<span id="fignotes">The AoC applies to sets bounded below as well, with greatest lower bounds.<br/></span>-->

<!--<span id="fignotes">These statements rely the fact that $\Bbb{N}$ is not bounded above.</span>-->

<!-- <p><br/>Starting with the <i>Axiom of Completeness</i>:
what does it mean for sets to be bounded, and how does this resolve paradoxes in our number system?</p>

<span><ul><li>Provides a generalization for minima and maxima, applied directly to sets.</li>
    <li>Demonstrates the incompleteness of \Bbb{Q} </li>
<li>A rigorous definition for limits will eventually follow from this starting point. </li>
</ul> 
</span>
--> <hr/>
The following observations about our number sets may be made:

<ul id="observations">

  <li>The natural numbers set $\Bbb{N}$ leads with 1, so the natural set is bounded below (infinum of 1). It is <u>not</u> bounded above.
  Absence of an upper-bound fits with layman and historical notions of the infinite: the natural set begins but it never ends.</li>
  </ul>$$\Bbb{N} = \{1,2,3,4,\dots \}$$
  <ul id="observations"><li>The integer set $\Bbb{Z}$ is not bounded above, but unlike $\Bbb{N}$ the set is not bounded below. However, they are ordered and countably infinite, like the natural number set $\Bbb{N}$.</li>
  </ul>$$\Bbb{Z} = \{ \dots , -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \dots \}$$
  <ul id="observations"><li>The rational field $\Bbb{Q}$ contains the set $\Bbb{Z}$. Therefore, $\Bbb{Q}$ will not be bounded below or above, yet it is still ordered and countably infinite.</li>
  </ul>$$\Bbb{Q} = \{ p/q : p \land q \in \Bbb{Z},\ q \notin 0 \}$$


<br/><div style="text-align:center;"><img id="setcenter" src="../Index/calc/trumpet/sets.png" alt="sets" width="150px" height="90px"/></div>
<span>Defining $\Bbb{Q}$ requires "more" notation than its subsets. Despite being countably infinite like the naturals and the integers, it is impossible to list adjacent elements in the rational number set.<br/></span>

<hr/>
<p>Applying this concept elsewhere, consider some set $A$ with elements that are ordered as such:</p>

$$
A = \{r^2 \gt 2\ :\ x \in \Bbb{Q}\} \tag{Eq. 3}
$$

<p>Set $A$ contains all rational numbers $r^2$ that are greater than 2, not including 2 itself.</p> 
<ul><li>Rational numbers form an ordered set (field) that is countable, 
  and set <i>A</i> contains all rationals greater than 2</li>
<li>Therefore, set <i>A</i> is also ordered and countable; these properties are inherited from $\Bbb{Q}$.</li>
<li><i>A</i> must be <u>bounded below</u> with a <u>greatest lower bound</u> (infinum) of 2, despite $2 \notin A$.</li></ul>

$$ \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{ \text{inf} A=2} $$

<hr/>

<!--<p>This points towards the rational set being undoubtably "bigger" than the integer set. However, this is untrue. 
  Cardinality and equinumerosity give us the result that $\Bbb{Z}$ and $\Bbb{Q}$ actually have the same number of elements as each other and $\Bbb{N}$.</p>
<ul><li>In fact, it's even less intuitive. If |$\Bbb{Z}$| denotes the cardinatlity (# of elements) in the integer set $\Bbb{Z}$, 
  then it is fact that:</li></ul>

  <span>

    $$

    |\Bbb{N}|=|\Bbb{Z}|=|\Bbb{Q}|=\aleph_0 \tag{Eq. 3} $$
  </span>

  <span>Using real analysis, we can arrive at this conclusion by showing that each set can be bijectively mapped onto any of the three.
