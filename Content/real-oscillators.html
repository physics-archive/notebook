    <h1 id="header">Oscillators and Diff. Eq. in Nature</h1>
    
    <p>Oscillators are a natural phenomenon. Rotating bodies have cyclical motion, as does some mass on a spring. 
      Moreover, systems that are elusive to direct 
      observation (i.e., an electric-field propogating through some insulating material) are accurately accurately modeled 
      as physical oscillators. <br/><br/>Many nuclear and microscopic systems behave like damped oscillators. 
      Maxwell's Equations lead to a wave equation whose solutions are our  
      electromagnetic model for light (oscillating <i>E-</i> and <i>B-</i>fields that propogate with a velocity). 
    </p>  
    
    <p>
      
      Often, it is easier to mathematically identify the sources of change to our system, 
      rather than arriving immediately at a mathematical model. 
      <!--<ul><li>For instance: an object in free-fall is subject to a total force of $mg$ -- but what 
        is $\vect{r}(t)$ exactly? It can be easily determined or recalled, but you can see that our logic <i>begins</i> with 
        change, which progresses to a comprehensive solution for motion (position). 
      </li><li>This is a reflection of utilizing differential equations: we start with a statement about change (the differential equation), 
        and then we solve it to obtain a statement on how our system evolves over time (i.e., motion over time).
      </li></ul>-->

      <!--Later, we will return to closely
      examine $\Psi$ and its perplexing properties from the beginning.
      Consider this page a motivating preface to a volume on early Quantum Particle Mechanics.
      </p>-->
      <hr/><h3 id="section">Constructing and Justifying our Differential Equation</h3>
  
      <p>Hooke's law describes a restorative force: $F=-kx$. What is $-kx$ <i>really</i> describing? 
      <ul><li>As our system moves away from equillibrium ($x_0=0$), a force directed towards $x_0$ grows in order to 
        is restore system position; its direction always points towards the equillibrium point $x_0$.
      </li></ul>
      <!--<li>Notice that if our sign is reversed to say $F=+kx$, our force is directed <i>away</i> from equillibrium. Position will never 
      return to $x=0$ once displacement away from $x_0$ occurs. This describes exponential, positive feedback.</li></ul></p>-->

      <p>Let us use intuition to define each contribution to $\vect{F}$ for our real mass-on-a-spring:</p>

      <ul><li>$F_{spring}(x)= -kx$: A restorative force that depends explicitly on position. 
        <br/>Proportional to our spring constant $k$.</li>
        <li>$F_{damp}(v)= +\beta \dot{x}$: A frictional force. Opposes velocity and causes energy loss (nonconservative force). Proportional to some 
          damping factor $\beta$.
        </li></ul>
<hr/>
        <p>Newton's Equation for our spring system follows:</p>

        $$
        F_{total} - F_{spring} - F_{damp} = 0$$
        
        $$m \ddot{x} - \beta \dot{x} + kx = 0

        $$

      
        $$\blbox{m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} - \beta \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0}
        \tag{Eq. 1}
        $$
        <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 1</b> - Linear, second-order, ordinary differential equation. Force assocaited with a mass 
          on a spring, with friction accounted for in our second term.</p>

        <p>
          Undoubtably, constructing (Eq. 1) was far easier than jumping straight to its solution, <i>x(t)</i>. In solving (Eq. 1), we will 
          demonstrate that <i>x(t)</i> is not trivial, and would not have been easily-obtainable with algebra or empirical methods alone.
        </p>
<ul><li>Constructing differential equations is where much of our physics 
  efforts get concentrated. A computer (or mathematician) can often do the brute work of actually <i>solving</i> the equations that we create to model our system. 
  Refer to the Spherical Bessel Functions.
</li>
<li>However, physical intuition is often required to simplify equations and make them solvable.</li></ul>

<hr/><h3 id="section">Solving our Differential Equation for Real Spring Motion</h3>

<p>Making our lives easier: (Eq. 1) is actually homogonous in addition to being linear and ordinary. 
  Given these properties, our complete (most general) solution needs to have the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>
    <b>Second-order, Linear diff. eq.</b>: full solution must be a superposition of two 
    linearly-independent solutions: $x_{full}(t)=C_1x_1(t)+C_2x_2(t)$. We will two arbitrary constants to solve for ($C_1,C_2$).
</li>
<li><b>Ordinary diff. eq..:</b> usually far easier to appraoch and solve than partial differential equations. 
  The solution set will be finite as opposed to infinite (in the case of PDEs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Examine the most genearlized oscillatory function we can come up with, but label it as being a part of some index <i>j</i> to remind ourselves 
that we expect to find exactly two solutions of <i>x(t)</i> (<i>j</i>=2):

$$x_n(t)=C_n e^{i \omega_n t} \tag {Eq. 2.1}$$

Our most generalized solution is some linear combination of these two solutions:</p>
$$\blbox{x(t)=C_1 e^{i \omega_1 t} + C_2 e^{i \omega_2 t}} \tag{Eq. 2.2} $$

<p>While the overall shape of this solution matches our spring motion, 
  we need to test (Eq. 2.1) as a solution (Eq. 1) for two reason:
  <ul><li>to prove that (Eq. 2.2) definitely solves (Eq. 1) for all <i>t</i>, and</li>
  <li>to determine the parameters
    that actually define physical characteristics of our system: $C_n$ and $\omega_n$.
  <br/><br/>Thinking ahead: consider what $\omega$ and $C_n$ actually correspond to, physically. Hint: consider their dimensions and how their limits influence our spring description.</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Testing (Eq. 2.1) in (Eq. 1), we verify our solution for <i>x(t)</i>is correct, and we obtain $\omega_n$. 
  Since this page is supposed to be complementary to an introductory diff. eq., many steps will 
  be shown as to not jump too many conclusions at once:
</p>

$$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} [C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{\beta}{m}\right) \frac{d}{dt} [C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{k}{m}\right) [C_n e^{i \omega_n t} ]= 0  

$$
Perform our time-derivatives in terms one and two:
$$ i^2 \omega_n^2 [e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{\beta}{m}\right) i \omega_n[C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{k}{m}\right) [C_n e^{i \omega_n t} ]= 0  

$$
Pull out common factors to reveal an interesting expression (and recall $i^2=-1$):

$$\blbox{C_n e^{i \omega_n t} \left(
- \omega_n^2 - \frac{\beta}{m}\omega_n +k


\right) = 0}

\tag {Eq. 3.1} $$

Our question: is (Eq. 3)? If yes, then (Eq. 2.2) solves (Eq. 1), and we can proceed with 
finding $\omega_n$ and $C_n$ and finally model our spring motion.

<p>In proving that our equality holds, we need to eliminate this exponential term. Algebraically, this is no problem:
  divide both sides by $C_n e^{i \omega_n t}$. We lose information about $C_n$, but we can solve for $\omega_n$ and prove that our left-hand-side (LHS) 
is equal to zero.</p>
