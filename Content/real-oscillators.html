    <p>Oscillators are a natural phenomenon. Rotating bodies have cyclical motion, as does some mass on a spring. 
      Moreover, systems that are elusive to direct 
      observation (i.e., an electric-field propogating through some insulating material) are accurately accurately modeled 
      as physical oscillators. <br/><br/>Many nuclear and microscopic systems behave like damped oscillators. 
      Maxwell's Equations lead to a wave equation whose solutions are our  
      electromagnetic model for light (oscillating <i>E-</i> and <i>B-</i>fields that propogate with a velocity). 
    </p>  
    
    <p>
      
      Often, it is easier to mathematically identify the sources of change to our system, 
      rather than arriving immediately at a mathematical model. 
      <!--<ul><li>For instance: an object in free-fall is subject to a total force of $mg$ -- but what 
        is $\vect{r}(t)$ exactly? It can be easily determined or recalled, but you can see that our logic <i>begins</i> with 
        change, which progresses to a comprehensive solution for motion (position). 
      </li><li>This is a reflection of utilizing differential equations: we start with a statement about change (the differential equation), 
        and then we solve it to obtain a statement on how our system evolves over time (i.e., motion over time).
      </li></ul>-->

      <!--Later, we will return to closely
      examine $\Psi$ and its perplexing properties from the beginning.

      <p>Hooke's law describes a restorative force: $F=-kx$. What is $-kx$ <i>really</i> describing? 
      <ul><li>As our system moves away from equillibrium ($x_0=0$), a force directed towards $x_0$ grows in order to 
        is restore system position; its direction always points towards the equillibrium point $x_0$.
      </li></ul>
      <!--<li>Notice that if our sign is reversed to say $F=+kx$, our force is directed <i>away</i> from equillibrium. Position will never 
      return to $x=0$ once displacement away from $x_0$ occurs. This describes exponential, positive feedback.</li></ul></p>-->

      <p>Let us use intuition to define each contribution to $\vect{F}$ for our real mass-on-a-spring:</p>

      <ul><li>$F_{spring}(x)= -kx$: A restorative force that depends explicitly on position. 
        <br/>Proportional to our spring constant $k$.</li>
        <li>$F_{damp}(v)= -\beta \dot{x}$: A frictional force. Opposes velocity and causes energy loss (nonconservative force). Proportional to some 
          damping factor $\beta$.
        </li></ul>
<hr/>
        <p>Newton's Equation for our spring system follows:</p>

        $$
        F_{total} - F_{spring} - F_{damp} = 0$$
        
        $$m \ddot{x} + \beta \dot{x} + kx = 0

        $$

      
        $$\blbox{m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \beta \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0}
        \tag{Eq. 1}
        $$
        <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 1</b> - Linear, second-order, ordinary differential equation. Force assocaited with a mass

        <p>
          Undoubtably, constructing (Eq. 1) was far easier than jumping straight to its solution, <i>x(t)</i>. In solving (Eq. 1), we will 
          demonstrate that <i>x(t)</i> is not trivial, and would not have been easily-obtainable with algebra or empirical methods alone.
        </p>
<ul><li>Constructing differential equations is where much of our physics 
  efforts get concentrated. A computer (or mathematician) can often do the brute work of actually <i>solving</i> the equations that we create to model our system. 
  Refer to the Spherical Bessel Functions.
</li>
<li>However, physical intuition is often required to simplify equations and make them solvable.</li></ul>

<hr/><h3 id="section">Solving our Differential Equation for Real Spring Motion</h3>
<p>For completeness, it is necessary to consider <i>x(t)</i> to be complex-valued when solving our differential equation. 
However, our physical (observable) system is described only by its real part (not its imaginary). 
We will write Re[x(t)] <i>after</i> working out our 
complex solution. Going forward, <i>i</i> will play a fundamental role in defining oscillatory functions.</p>
<p>Making our lives easier: (Eq. 1) is actually homogonous in addition to being linear and ordinary. 
  Given these properties, our complete (most general) solution needs to have the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>
    <b>Second-order, Linear diff. eq.</b>: full solution must be a superposition of two 
    linearly-independent solutions: $x_{full}(t)=C_1x_1(t)+C_2x_2(t)$. We will produce two arbitrary constants to solve for ($C_1,C_2$), 
    given to us by initial conditions of our system.
</li>
<li><b>Ordinary diff. eq..:</b> usually far easier to appraoch and solve than partial differential equations. 
  The solution set will be finite as opposed to infinite (in the case of PDEs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Examine the most genearlized oscillatory function we can come up with, but label it as being a part of some index <i>j</i> to remind ourselves 
that we expect to find exactly two solutions of <i>x(t)</i> (<i>j</i>=2):

$$x_n(t)=C_n e^{i \omega_n t} \tag {Eq. 2.1}$$
<p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 2.1 - </b>$C_n$ are complex-valued constants, and may have imaginary parts!</p>
Our most generalized solution is some linear combination of these two solutions:</p>
$$\blbox{x(t)=C_1 e^{i \omega_1 t} + C_2 e^{i \omega_2 t}} \tag{Eq. 2.2} $$

<!--
<p>While the overall shape of this solution matches our spring motion, 
  we need to test (Eq. 2.1) as a solution (Eq. 1) for two reason:
  <ul><li>to prove that (Eq. 2.2) definitely solves (Eq. 1) for all <i>t</i>, and</li>
  <li>to determine the parameters ($C_n$, $\omega_n$)
    which actually define physical characteristics of our system.
  <br/><br/>Thinking ahead: consider what $\omega$ and $C_n$ actually correspond to, physically. Hint: consider their dimensions and how their limits influence our spring description.</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Testing (Eq. 2.1) in (Eq. 1), we verify our solution for <i>x(t)</i>is correct, and we obtain $\omega_n$. 
  Since this page is supposed to be complementary to an introductory diff. eq., many steps will 
  be shown as to not jump too many conclusions at once:
</p> -->

<p>Substitute this full solution into our equation of motion to start determining our solution parameters ($C_n, \omega_n$):
</p>
$$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} [C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{\beta}{m}\right) \frac{d}{dt} [C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{k}{m}\right) [C_n e^{i \omega_n t} ]= 0  

$$
Perform our time-derivatives in terms one and two:
$$ i^2 \omega_n^2 [e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{\beta}{m}\right) i \omega_n[C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{k}{m}\right) [C_n e^{i \omega_n t} ]= 0  

$$
Pull out common factors to reveal an interesting expression (recall $i^2=-1$):

$$\blbox{C_n e^{i \omega_n t} \left(
- \omega_n^2 + i\frac{\beta}{m}\omega_n + \frac{k}{m}


\right) = 0}

\tag {Eq. 3.1} $$

<p>In proving that our equality holds, we need to eliminate this exponential term. 
  <ul>
    <li>Algebraically, this is no problem:
    divide both sides by $C_n e^{i \omega_n t}$ to obtain our simplified eigenvalue equation.</li>
  
  <li>A less hand-waivy argument: the quantity $e^{i \omega_n t}$ will never equal zero, so the only zeros (roots)
    in our quadratic equation (Eq. 3.1) have to come from particular values of $\omega_n$ (our eigenfrequencies):
  </li></ul>

  $$\blbox{ - \omega_n^2 + i\frac{\beta}{m}\omega_n + \frac{k}{m} = 0 } \tag{Eq. 3.2}$$



Define the following substitutions (to simplify math and compress system parameters), and solve our auxillary equation 
for complex-valued eigenfrequencies:

$$\begin{align} \beta /m \rightarrow 2\gamma \\ k/m \rightarrow \kappa^2 \end{align}$$ <!--substitution of parameters-->

$$ - \omega_n^2 + 2i\gamma \omega_n + \kappa^2 = 0 $$

$$\blbox{\omega_{1,2} = i\gamma \pm \sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}}  \tag {Eq. 3.3}$$


<!--<p class="eqcomment">Notice our eigenfrequencies are complex-valued, here.</p>-->
Therefore, our general solution for damped spring motion is given by substituting (Eq. 3.3) in (Eq. 2.2):

$$ x(t)=
  C_1 e^{i^2 \gamma t} e^{+i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t} + 
  C_2 e^{i^2 \gamma t} e^{-i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t}
  
$$

 $$ \blbox{x(t)= e^{-\gamma t}
  \left(C_1 e^{+i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t} + 
  C_2 e^{-i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t} \right)
  } 
 \tag{Eq. 4}$$

We already see an interesting quality of our solution to damped motion: our particle is oscillating 
with some new frequency that is related by its natural frequency ($\kappa$ - the undamped frequency) and 
the systen damping (encoded in $\beta$). We can proceed to write down the purely-real (physical) form to this solution.
<ul><li>$e^{-\gamma t}$ - Factor corresponding to pure exponential decay over time. A damping term.</li>
<li>$\left(C_1e^{...} +C_2e^{...} \right)$ - Factor corresponding to undamped oscillation of the system in time.</li></ul>

 <b>Plot 1</b> - Plot of (Eq. 4) for arbitrary parameters ($\gamma \lt \kappa$). 
 Predicts oscillating motion that decays in amplitude over time. Matches our expectation of how a 
 damped harmonic oscillator will behave. Changes shape if $\gamma \ge \kappa$ (critical/overdamping).
</p>
<hr/><h3 id="section">The Real Part of our Solution</h3>
<p>Our complex-valued solution is the most general description we have for damped oscillations in 1-D. 
  However, the imaginary part (Im[<i>x(t)</i>]) does not describe any observable behavior, so we should disregard it
  and pursue a trigonometric form for (Eq. 4), so that we may readily apply our model to physical systems:
</p>

$$ x(t) \rightarrow \text{Re}[x(t)] $$
$$ C_n \rightarrow A_n+iB_n $$
$$ \sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2} \rightarrow \Omega$$
<p>Note that $A_n, B_n$ are real-valued coefficients, and $\Omega$ is a frequency that we can think of as our 
  damped oscillation frequency. Our real solution to motion comes out with surprising brevity:
</p>
$$x(t) \rightarrow e^{-\gamma t}\ \text{Re}\left[
(A_1 + iB_1) e^{+i \Omega t} + 
  (A_2 + iB_2) e^{-i \Omega t}
\right] $$

$$\begin{align} x(t) = e^{\gamma t}\ ( &\text{Re}[
A_1 \cos{t\Omega} + A_2 \cos{t\Omega} + B_1 \sin{t\Omega} - B_2 \sin{t\Omega}] \\ 
- &\text{Re}[
i A_1 \sin{t\Omega} - i A_2 \sin{t\Omega} - iB_1 \cos{t\Omega} - iB_2 \cos{t\Omega}
] ) \end{align} \tag{Eq. 5}$$

<p>I have carefully grouped terms in (Eq. 5) such that it is clear which of our trigonometric terms are purely real versus 
  purely imaginary -- our real solution for <i>x(t)</i> is clearly visible:
</p>

$$x(t) = e^{-\gamma t} \left[ (A_1 + A_2) \cos{\Omega t} + (B_1 - B_2) \sin{\Omega t} \right] $$
Compressing our solution constants yet again, we obtain an elegant solution to damped harmonic motion:
$$\blbox{x(t) = e^{-\gamma t} \left[ A\cos{\Omega t} + B{\cos{\Omega t}} \right]} \tag {Eq. 6} $$
