    <p>Oscillators are a natural phenomenon. Rotating bodies have cyclical motion, as does some mass on a spring. 
      Moreover, systems that are elusive to direct 
      observation (i.e., an electric-field propogating through some insulating material) are accurately accurately modeled 
      as physical oscillators. <br/><br/>In fact, a plethora of nuclear and microscopic systems behave like damped oscillators. 
      Even Maxwell's Equations form a wave equation, whose solutions are our  
      electromagnetic wave-model of light (that is, oscillating <i>E-</i> and <i>B-</i>fields). 
    </p>  
    
    <p>
      
      Often, it is easier to mathematically identify the sources of change to our system, 
      as opposed to obtaining a direct solution to how those sources actually compound to result in our overall system behavior. 
      <ul><li>For instance: an object in free-fall is subject to a total force of $mg$ -- but what 
        is $\vect{r}(t)$ exactly? It can be easily determined or recalled, but you can see that our logic <i>begins</i> with 
        change, which progresses to a comprehensive solution for motion (position). 
      </li><li>This is a reflection of utilizing differential equations: we start with a statement about change (the differential equation), 
        and then we solve it to obtain a statement on how our system evolves over time (i.e., motion over time).
      </li></ul>

      <!--Later, we will return to closely
      examine $\Psi$ and its perplexing properties from the beginning.

      <p>Hooke's law describes a restorative force: $F=-kx$. What is $-kx$ <i>really</i> describing? 
      <ul><li>As our system moves away from equillibrium ($x_0=0$), a force directed towards $x_0$ grows in order to 
        is restore system position; it opposes displacement away from equillibrium.
      </li>
      <li>Notice that if our sign is reversed to say $F=+kx$, our force is directed <i>away</i> from equillibrium. Position will never 
      return to $x=0$ once displacement away from $x_0$ occurs.</li></ul></p>

      <p>Let us use intuition to define each contribution to $\vect{F}$ for our real mass-on-a-spring:</p>

      <ul><li>$F_{spring}(x)= -kx$: A restorative force that depends explicitly on position. 
        <br/>Proportional to our spring constant $k$.</li>
        <li>$F_{damp}(v)= +\beta \dot{x}$: A frictional force. Opposes velocity and causes energy loss (nonconservative force). Proportional to some 
          damping factor $\beta$.
        </li></ul>
<hr/>
        <p>Newton's Equation for our spring system follows:</p>

        $$
        F_{total} - F_{spring} - F_{damp} = 0$$
        
        $$m \ddot{x} - \beta \dot{x} + kx = 0

        $$

      
        $$\blbox{m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} - \beta \frac{dx}{dt} + kx = 0}
        \tag{Eq. 1}
        $$
        <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 1</b> - Linear, second-order, ordinary differential equation. Force assocaited with a mass 
          on a spring, with friction accounted for in our second term.</p>

        <p>
          Undoubtably, constructing (Eq. 1) was far easier than jumping straight to its solution, <i>x(t)</i>. In solving (Eq. 1), we will 
          demonstrate that <i>x(t)</i> is not trivial, and would not have been easily-obtainable with algebra or empirical methods alone.
        </p>
<ul><li>Constructing differential equations is where much of our physics 
  efforts get concentrated. A computer (or mathematician) can often do the brute work of actually <i>solving</i> the equations that we create to model our system. 
  Refer to the Spherical Bessel Functions.
</li>
<li>However, physical intuition is often required to simplify equations and make them solvable.</li></ul>
