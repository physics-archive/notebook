        <p>
          Undoubtably, constructing (Eq. 1) was far easier than jumping straight to its solution, <i>x(t)</i>. In solving (Eq. 1), we will 
          demonstrate that <i>x(t)</i> is not trivial, and would not have been easily-obtainable with algebra or empirical methods alone.
        </p>
<ul><li>Constructing differential equations is where much of our physics 
  efforts get concentrated. A computer (or mathematician) can often do the brute work of actually <i>solving</i> the equations that we create to model our system. 
  Refer to the Spherical Bessel Functions.
</li>
<li>However, physical intuition is often required to simplify equations and make them solvable.</li></ul>

<hr/><h3 id="section">Complex-Valued Solution to the Differential Equation for Real Spring Motion</h3>
<p>For completeness, it is necessary to consider <i>x(t)</i> to be complex-valued when solving our differential equation. 
However, our physical (observable) system is described only by its real part (not its imaginary). 
We will write Re[x(t)] <i>after</i> working out our 
complex solution.</p>
<p>First observation: (Eq. 1) is actually homogonous in addition to being linear and ordinary. 
  Given these properties, our complete (most general) solution must satisfy the following:
</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>
    <b>Second-order, Linear diff. eq.</b>: full solution must be a superposition of two 
    linearly-independent solutions: $x_{full}(t)=C_1x_1(t)+C_2x_2(t)$. We will produce two complex-valued constants ($C_1,C_2$). 
    Initial conditions and constraints on our system will lead to determinations of these constants. 
    $C_1$ and $C_2$ determine the <i>weight</i> of each linearly-independent solution to our (Eq. 1).
</li>
<li><b>Ordinary diff. eq..:</b> usually far easier to appraoch and solve than partial differential equations. 
  The solution set will be finite as opposed to infinite (in the case of PDEs).</li>
</ul>

<p>Examine the most genearlized oscillatory function we can come up with. In $\Bbb{R}^2$, we expect 
  to find that it has two solutions, as it is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):

$$x_n(t)=C_n e^{i \omega_n t} \tag {Eq. 2.1}$$
<p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 2.1 - </b>$C_n$ are complex-valued constants, and may have imaginary parts!</p>
Our most generalized solution, then, is some linear combination of these two solutions:</p>
$$\blbox{x(t)=C_1 e^{i \omega_1 t} + C_2 e^{i \omega_2 t}} \tag{Eq. 2.2} $$

<!--
<p>While the overall shape of this solution matches our spring motion, 
  we need to test (Eq. 2.1) as a solution (Eq. 1) for two reason:
  <ul><li>to prove that (Eq. 2.2) definitely solves (Eq. 1) for all <i>t</i>, and</li>
  <li>to determine the parameters ($C_n$, $\omega_n$)
    which actually define physical characteristics of our system.
  <br/><br/>Thinking ahead: consider what $\omega$ and $C_n$ actually correspond to, physically. Hint: consider their dimensions and how their limits influence our spring description.</li></ul>
</p>

<p>Testing (Eq. 2.1) in (Eq. 1), we verify our solution for <i>x(t)</i>is correct, and we obtain $\omega_n$. 
  Since this page is supposed to be complementary to an introductory diff. eq., many steps will 
  be shown as to not jump too many conclusions at once:
</p> -->
<hr/><h3 id="section">Reduction to an Eigenvalue Problem</h3>

<p>Substitute this full solution into our equation of motion to start determining our solution parameters ($C_n, \omega_n$):
</p>
$$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} [C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{\beta}{m}\right) \frac{d}{dt} [C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{k}{m}\right) [C_n e^{i \omega_n t} ]= 0  

$$
Perform our time-derivatives in terms one and two:
$$ i^2 \omega_n^2 [C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{\beta}{m}\right) i \omega_n[C_n e^{i \omega_n t}] + 
\left(\frac{k}{m}\right) [C_n e^{i \omega_n t} ]= 0  

$$
Pull out common factors to reveal a quadratic equation, and our eigenvalue problem. Recall $i^2=-1$:

$$\blbox{C_n e^{i \omega_n t} \left(
- \omega_n^2 + i\frac{\beta}{m}\omega_n + \frac{k}{m}


\right) = 0}

\tag {Eq. 3.1} $$

<p>We need to eliminate this exponential term in order to solve the auxillary (or <i>secular</i>) equation (3.2).
  <ul>
    <li>Algebraically, this is no problem:
    divide both sides by $C_n e^{i \omega_n t}$ to obtain (Eq. 3.2).</li>
  
  <li>Less hand-waivy: the quantity $e^{i \omega_n t}$ can never equal zero, so the only zeros (roots)
    in (Eq. 3.1) <i>must</i> follow from particular choices of $\omega_n$ (our eigenfrequencies):
  </li></ul>

  $$\blbox{ - \omega_n^2 + i\frac{\beta}{m}\omega_n + \frac{k}{m} = 0 } \tag{Eq. 3.2}$$
  <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 3.2 </b>- Polynomial which is degree-two in $\omega_n$.</p>


The upcoming math may be simplified by defining the following, algebraic substitutions:

$$\begin{align} \beta /m \rightarrow 2\gamma \\ k/m \rightarrow \kappa^2 \end{align}$$ <!--substitution of parameters-->

<p>Solve the auxillary equation to obtain two complex-valued eigenvalues:</p>
$$ - \omega_n^2 + 2i\gamma \omega_n + \kappa^2 = 0 $$

$$\blbox{\omega_{1,2} = i\gamma \pm \sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}}  \tag {Eq. 3.3}$$


<!--<p class="eqcomment">Notice our eigenfrequencies are complex-valued, here.</p>-->
Therefore, our general solution for damped spring motion is given by substituting (Eq. 3.3) in (Eq. 2.2):

$$ x(t)=
  C_1 e^{i^2 \gamma t} e^{+i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t} + 
  C_2 e^{i^2 \gamma t} e^{-i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t}
  
$$

 $$ \blbox{x(t)= e^{-\gamma t}
  \left(C_1 e^{+i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t} + 
  C_2 e^{-i \left(\sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t} \right)
  } 
 \tag{Eq. 4}$$

We already see an interesting quality of our solution to damped motion: our particle is oscillating 
with some new (relative to undamped motion) frequency that is related by its natural frequency ($\kappa$) and 
the systen damping (encoded in $\beta$). <br/><br/> Interestingly, <i>x(t)</i> is a product of two distinctly-shaped 
functions: a factor that decays purely-exponentially in time, and a purely-oscillatory factor:
<ul><li>$e^{-\gamma t}$ - Factor corresponding to pure exponential decay over time. A damping term, independnet of $\kappa$.</li>
<li>$\left(C_1e^{...} +C_2e^{...} \right)$ - Factor corresponding to undamped oscillation of the system in time. Determined by both $\gamma$ and $\kappa$.</li></ul>

</p>
<hr/><h3 id="section">The Real-Valued Part of <i>x(t)</i></h3>
<p>Our complex-valued solution is the most complete description for damped oscillations in 1-D. 
  However, the imaginary part ( Im[<i>x(t)</i>] ) does not contribute to any observable behavior, so we may disregard it
  and pursue a trigonometric form for (Eq. 4). 
  To drop the imaginary part and clean notation, make the following substitutions:
</p>

$$ x(t) \rightarrow \text{Re}[x(t)] $$
$$ C_n \rightarrow A_n+iB_n $$
$$ \sqrt{\kappa^2 - \gamma^2} \rightarrow \Omega$$
<p>Note that $A_n, B_n$ are real-valued coefficients. The <i>damped frequency</i>, $\Omega$, varies between the natural frequency and 0 for positive damping (i.e., $\gamma>0$). 
  Damping results in energy loss, meaning the damped frequency ($\Omega$) is always 
  less than the natural (undamped) frequency ($\kappa$). 
  This mathemtical result makes intuitive sense (a luxury of solving classical systems).
  
  
  <br/><br/>Given these substitutions, the real-valued part of (Eq. 4) may be expressed in a very manageable form:
</p>
$$x(t) \rightarrow e^{-\gamma t}\ \text{Re}\left[
(A_1 + iB_1) e^{+i \Omega t} + 
  (A_2 + iB_2) e^{-i \Omega t}
\right] $$

$$\begin{align} x(t) = e^{\gamma t}\ ( &\text{Re}[
A_1 \cos{\Omega t} + A_2 \cos{\Omega t} + B_1 \sin{\Omega t} - B_2 \sin{\Omega t}] \\ 
- &\text{Re}[
i A_1 \sin{ \Omega t} - i A_2 \sin{\Omega t} - iB_1 \cos{\Omega t} - iB_2 \cos{ \Omega t}
] ) \end{align} \tag{Eq. 5}$$

<p>I have carefully grouped terms in (Eq. 5) such that it is clear which of our trigonometric terms are purely real versus 
  purely imaginary -- our real solution for <i>x(t)</i> is clearly visible:
</p>

$$x(t) = e^{-\gamma t} \left[ (A_1 + A_2) \cos{\Omega t} + (B_1 - B_2) \sin{\Omega t} \right] $$
Compressing our solution constants yet again, we obtain an elegant solution to damped harmonic motion:
$$\blbox{x(t) = e^{-\gamma t} \left[ A\cos{\Omega t} + B{\sin{\Omega t}} \right]} \tag {Eq. 6} $$
<p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 6</b> - The real-valued solution to Newton's equation for damped, harmonic motion (Eq. 1). 
  The damped oscillation-frequency ($\Omega$) may be imaginary, necessitating the use of complex analysis (or Eq. 4) to

<ul class="stard"> <li> Coefficients <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are the only quantities that remain unknown. It makes sense that we still have

<p class="eqcomment"> <b>Figure 2</b> - Plots of <i>x(t)</i> for different damping strengths.
The complex nature of <i>x(t)</i> encodes our lack of real roots in the overdamped case, and we lose 
our oscillatory behavior, slowing the system before equillibrium is reached (hence no real roots).</p>


<p>Our eigenfrequency $\Omega$ is influenced by the damping strength,
 implying that the mechanism for energy loss causes decay in amplitude <u>in addition to</u> 
 down-shifting the oscillation periodicity from its undamped value (when $\gamma=0$). Indeed,
 the overdamped case is an exaggerated form of why amplitude decay <u>must</u> be occompanied
 by a down-shift in oscillation frequency. 
</p>

<hr/><h3 id="section">Brief Verification of our Solution</h3>
<p>Prior to a discussion, we should demonstrate explicitly that <i>x(t)</i> really does solve
(Eq. 1). Use the complex-valued form (Eq. 4) over the real part (Eq. 6) in order to keep terms compact and avoid errors.</p>

$$ \ddf{x}{t} + 2\gamma \frac{dx}{dt}+\kappa^2 x = 0$$
<!--Simplifying the differential equation-->
$$
\frac{d^2}{dt^2} \left[
e^{-\gamma t} \left( C_1 e^{i \Omega t} + C_2 e^{-i \Omega t} \right) \right] 
+
2\gamma \frac{d}{dt} \left[
e^{-\gamma t} \left( C_1 e^{i \Omega t} + C_2 e^{-i \Omega t} \right) \right]  +
\kappa^2 \left[
e^{-\gamma t} \left( C_1 e^{i \Omega t} + C_2 e^{-i \Omega t} \right) \right] \stackrel{?}{=} 0
 $$
$$ <!--Long diff eq.-->
-\left( \Omega^2 -\kappa^2 + \gamma^2) e^{-\gamma t} (C_1 e^{i \Omega t} + C_2 e^{-i \Omega t} \right) \stackrel{?}{=} 0
$$

<!-- <p class="eqcomment"> Recall $\Omega = \sqrt{\kappa^2-\gamma^2}$</p> -->

$$
 \cancelto{0}{([ \kappa^2 - \gamma^2 ] -\kappa^2 + \gamma^2)} e^{-\gamma t} \left( C_1 e^{i \Omega t} + C_2 e^{-i \Omega t} 
 \right) \stackrel{\unicode{10004}}{=} 0
$$
Therefore, <i>x(t)</i> is a solution to (Eq. 1) for any choice for $\beta, m, k$, and <i>t</i>.
