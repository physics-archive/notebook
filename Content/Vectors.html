      <!--Later, we will return to closely
      examine $\Psi$ and its perplexing properties from the beginning.
      Consider this page a motivating preface to a volume on early Quantum Particle Mechanics.
      </p>-->
      <p>One-dimensional quantities like $x(t)$ are useful in cases where we have symmetries to exploit,
        but we need to rewrite Newton's Equation using vector calculus if we want a true 3-dimensional model of motion. 
        
      </p>
      <ul id="introlist">
        <li>Encoding our directional information in a position vector $\vect{r}(t)$ allows us
          to model motion directly in flat space $\Bbb{R}^3$.
        </li>
        <li>Vectors often complicate our mathematical modeling, but we are rewarded with a clearer picture
          of energy conservation and motion in general.</li>
          <li>This rigor will make the vector (and matrix) formulations of quantum mechanics far more approachable.</li>
          
      </ul>
      
        <hr/><h3 id="section">Rewriting Position, Velocity and Acceleration as 3-Vectors</h3>
      <p> 
        In transitioning from $x(t) \rightarrow \vect{r}(t)$, The following will serve as a brief overview 
        on vector-valued functions, and is best achieved by expressing our vectors
        in several equivalent forms. <br/><br/>The three elements of $\vect{r}$
        correspond to motion in the respective directions:
      </p>
    
    $$\vect{r}(t) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x(t)\\ y(t)\\ z(t)
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    x(t) \vecta{1}{0}{0} + 
    y(t) \vecta{0}{1}{0} +
    z(t) \vecta{0}{0}{1} \tag{Eq. 1}$$

    <p>Since our particle - i.e. $\vect{r}$ - exist in flat space, the length of our vector (relative
      to the origin) is given
      by the Pythagorean addition of its components: </p>
      
      $$ |\vect{r}(t)| = x(t) \oplus y(t) \oplus z(t) = \sqrt{[x(t)]^2+[y(t)]^2+[z(t)]^2}$$
    
      <p></p>
      <p>Differentiating $\vect{r}$ with respect to time will simply apply the <i>scalar</i>operation to each
        component, leading definitions for $\vect{a}$ and $\vect{v}$ that are analogous
        to our one-dimensional model: </p>

      $$\vect{a}(t) = \frac{d \vect{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2 \vect{r}}{dt^2} 
      = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \vecta{x(t)}{y(t)}{z(t)}
      = \vecta{\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}}{\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2}}{\frac{d^2 z(t)}{dt^2}}\tag{Eq. 2} $$
    <p class="eqcomment">Going forward,
      since time-derivatives behave as they did one-dimensionally, we can 
      invoke the familiar the notation from Newton: $\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)] = \dot{f}(t)$</p>
      
      <p>Putting everything back together, we obtain our vectorized Newton's Equation:</p>

      $$\bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{\vect{F}(\vect{r},t) = m \ddot{\vect{r}} = \begin{bmatrix} F_x\\ F_y\\ F_z \end{bmatrix} = 
      m \begin{bmatrix} 
      \ddot{x}(t)\\ \ddot{y}(t)\\ \ddot{z}(t) \end{bmatrix}} \tag{Eq. 3}$$
<p>Let's remind ourselves that force, on our lefthand-side, is determined by our system (i.e. whatever we're interested in), and $\ddot{\vect{r}}$ is the motion we're interested in solving.</p>
      
      <p>Evidently, this vector formulation is providing simultaneous solutions for three separare differential equations. 
        Our understanding of energy conservation (and conserved quantities in general) will be deepened
        by considering solutions to Newton's Equations in this matter.
      </p>

      <hr/><h3>Generalizing to N-Dimensional Functions</h3>
      <p>Notice, too, that this formulation is not limited to 3-dimensional vectors. For all flat coordinate
        systems (that is, $\Bbb{R}^k\ \text{for}\ k \in \Bbb{N}$), (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2) can be generalized:
         </p>
      
         $$\vect{G} =\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t)\\ x_2(t)\\ x_3(t)\\ \vdots\\ x_j(t) \end{bmatrix}\ \text{and}\ \ 
         | \vect{G}| = \sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{j} x_j(t)} \tag{Eq. 4}$$
      <p class ="eqcomment" style="text-align:center; font-size:10pt;"><b>Eq. 4</b> - Generalizations 
       of (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2), s.t. $\text{dim} \vect{G} = j$</p>
      <p>Why would we even care about generalizing a system beyond the 3-dimensional coordiante system?
        <ul><li>Dimensionality does not always have to denote <i>spatial dimensionality</i>.</li>
        <li>Think of lists or arrays in programming: their dimension corresponds to their size, and sometimes this 
          size may be quite large, dynamic, random, etc. </li>
        <li>Even when approaching problems <i>in</i> our 3D space, generalized coordinates prove useful. In a system of N-many particles, 
        we can denote different quantities $x_j$ for each particle, resulting in <i>j</i>-many dimensions to our system.</li>
        </ul>
