        In transitioning from $x(t) \rightarrow \vect{r}(t)$, The following will serve as a brief overview 
        on vector-valued functions, and is best achieved by expressing our vectors
        in several equivalent forms. <br/><br/>The three elements of $\vect{r}$
        correspond to motion in the respective directions:

    $$ \bbox[8px,border:0px solid black] {\vect{r}(t) =

    <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 1</b> - A vector in $\Bbb{R}^3$ measured from the origin (0,0).    
       The unit vectors which encode direction are length 1, and are denoted with a hat. They are not necessarily constant in a given coordinate system.</p>


    <p>Since our particle (and $\vect{r}$) exist in flat space, we can say that the length of our vector
       is a Pythagorean sum of its dimensional components: </p>
      
      $$\bbox[8px,border:0px solid black]{ |\vect{r}(t)| = x(t) \oplus y(t) \oplus z(t) = \sqrt{[x(t)]^2+[y(t)]^2+[z(t)]^2}} \tag{Eq. 2} $$

      $$\bbox[8px,border:0px solid black]{\vect{a}(t) = \frac{d \vect{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2 \vect{r}}{dt^2}

<p>Let's remind ourselves that force, on our lefthand-side, is determined by our system (i.e. whatever we're interested in), and $\ddot{\vect{r}}$ is the motion we're interested in solving.</p>
      
      <p>Evidently, this vector formulation is providing simultaneous solutions for three separare differential equations.

        <ul><li>Dimensionality does not always have to denote <i>spatial dimensionality</i>.</li>
        <li>Think of lists or arrays in programming: their dimension corresponds to their size, and sometimes this 
          size may be quite large, dynamic, random, etc. </li>
        <li>Even when approaching problems <i>in</i> our 3D space, generalized coordinates prove useful. In a system of N-many particles,

<p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 10 & 11</b> - $\vect{F}$ and $d \vect{r}$ are determined by our system force and path.

<p>Suddenly, our focus has shifted from the observable motion of our system ($\vect{r}$) to something
