      examine $\Psi$ and its perplexing properties from the beginning.
      Consider this page a motivating preface to a volume on early Quantum Particle Mechanics.
      </p>-->
      <p>One-dimensional quantities like $x(t)$ are useful in cases where we have symmetries to exploit,
        but we need to rewrite Newton's Equation using vector calculus if we want a true 3-dimensional model of motion. 
        
      </p>
      <ul id="introlist">
        <li>Encoding our directional information in a position vector $\vect{r}(t)$ allows us
          to model motion directly in flat space $\Bbb{R}^3$.
        </li>
        <li>Vectors often complicate our mathematical modeling, but we are rewarded with a clearer picture
          of our system motion. We can use these vector quantities as direct inputs for simulations via software, for example.</li>
          <li>This rigor will make the vector (and matrix) formulations of quantum mechanics far more approachable.</li>

      <p> 
        In transitioning from $x(t) \rightarrow \vect{r}(t)$, The following will serve as a brief overview 
        on vector-valued functions, and is best achieved by expressing our vectors
        in several equivalent forms. <br/><br/>The three elements of $\vect{r}$
        correspond to motion in the respective directions:
      </p>
    
    $$\vect{r}(t) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x(t)\\ y(t)\\ z(t)
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    x(t) \vecta{1}{0}{0} + 
    y(t) \vecta{0}{1}{0} +
    z(t) \vecta{0}{0}{1} \tag{Eq. 1}$$

    <p>Since our particle - i.e. $\vect{r}$ - exist in flat space, the length of our vector (relative
      to the origin) is given
      by the Pythagorean addition of its components: </p>
      
      $$ |\vect{r}(t)| = x(t) \oplus y(t) \oplus z(t) = \sqrt{[x(t)]^2+[y(t)]^2+[z(t)]^2}$$
    
      <p></p>
      <p>Differentiating $\vect{r}$ with respect to time will simply apply the operation to each
        component, leading definitions for $\vect{a}$ and $\vect{v}$ that are analogous
        to our one-dimensional model: </p>

      $$\vect{a}(t) = \frac{d \vect{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2 \vect{r}}{dt^2} 
      = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \vecta{x(t)}{y(t)}{z(t)}
      = \vecta{\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}}{\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2}}{\frac{d^2 z(t)}{dt^2}}\tag{Eq. 2} $$
      
      <p>It should be evident that vector formulation is <i>really</i> providing simultaneous solutions for three separare differential equations. Going forward,
      since time-derivatives behave as they did one-dimensionally, we can invoke the familiar the notation from Newton: $\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)] = \dot{f}(t)$.</p>
      
      <p>Notice, too, that this formulation is not limited to 3-dimensional vectors. For all flat coordinate
        systems (that is, $\Bbb{R}^k\ \text{for}\ k \in \Bbb{N}$), (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2) can be generalized:
         </p>
      
         $$\vect{G} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1(t)\\ x_2(t)\\ x_3(t)\\ \vdots\\ x_j(t) \end{bmatrix}\ \text{and}\ \ 
         | \vect{G}| = \sqrt{ \sum_{j=1}^{j} x_j(t)} \tag{Eq. 3}$$
      
      <p>Why do we even care about generalizing a system past our own 3-dimensional coordiante system?
        <ul><li><i>Dimensionality</i> does not always have to denote <i>spatial dimensionality</i>.</li>
        <li>Think of lists or arrays in programming - they have dimensionality that corresponds to size, and sometimes this 
          size may be quite large, or even dynamic. 
          Vectorized quantities are MATLAB's direct analogue to nested lists.</li>
        <li></li>
