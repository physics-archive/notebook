      <p>One-dimensional quantities like $x(t)$ are useful in cases where we have symmetries to exploit,

        <li>Encoding our directional information in a position vector $\vect{r}(t)$ allows us

        In transitioning from $x(t) \rightarrow \vect{r}(t)$, The following will serve as a brief overview 
        on vector-valued functions, and is best achieved by expressing our vectors
        in several equivalent forms. <br/><br/>The three elements of $\vect{r}$
        correspond to motion in the respective directions:
      </p>
    $$ \bbox[8px,border:0px solid black] {\vect{r}(t) = 
    \hat{ \mathrm{ \boldsymbol{r}}} \mathrm{ \boldsymbol{r}}(t)  =
    \begin{bmatrix}
      x(t)\\ y(t)\\ z(t)
    \end{bmatrix} = 
    x(t) \vecta{1}{0}{0} + 
    y(t) \vecta{0}{1}{0} +
    z(t) \vecta{0}{0}{1} } \tag{Eq. 1}$$

    <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 1</b> - A vector in $\Bbb{R}^3$ measured from the origin (0,0).    
       The unit vectors which encode direction are length 1, and are denoted with a hat. They are not necessarily constant in a given coordinate system.</p>


    <p>Since our particle (and $\vect{r}$) exist in flat space, we can say that the length of our vector
       is a Pythagorean sum of its dimensional components: </p>
      
      $$\bbox[8px,border:0px solid black]{ |\vect{r}(t)| = x(t) \oplus y(t) \oplus z(t) = \sqrt{[x(t)]^2+[y(t)]^2+[z(t)]^2}} \tag{Eq. 2} $$
    <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 2</b> - By definition, a unit vector is an operator which assigns direction to a quantity, but does not affect its magnitude: | $\hata{r}$ | = 1.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Differentiating $\vect{r}$ with respect to time will simply apply the <i>scalar</i>operation to each
        component, leading definitions for $\vect{a}$ and $\vect{v}$ that are analogous
        to our one-dimensional model: </p>

      $$\bbox[8px,border:0px solid black]{\vect{a}(t) = \frac{d \vect{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2 \vect{r}}{dt^2} 
      = \frac{d^2}{dt^2} \vecta{x(t)}{y(t)}{z(t)}
      = \vecta{\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}}{\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2}}{\frac{d^2 z(t)}{dt^2}} } \tag{Eq. 3} $$
    <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 3</b> - Since time-derivatives are behaving as they did one-dimensionally (like a scalar operation), we can 
      invoke the familiar the notation from Newton: $\frac{d}{dt}[f(t)] = \dot{f}(t)$</p>
      
      <p>Putting everything back together, we obtain our vectorized Newton's Equation:</p>

      $$\bbox[8px,border:0px solid black]{\vect{F}(\vect{r},t) = m \ddot{\vect{r}} = \begin{bmatrix} F_x\\ F_y\\ F_z \end{bmatrix} = 
      m \begin{bmatrix} 
      \ddot{x}(t)\\ \ddot{y}(t)\\ \ddot{z}(t) \end{bmatrix}} \tag{Eq. 4}$$
<p>Let's remind ourselves that force, on our lefthand-side, is determined by our system (i.e. whatever we're interested in), and $\ddot{\vect{r}}$ is the motion we're interested in solving.</p>
      
      <p>Evidently, this vector formulation is providing simultaneous solutions for three separare differential equations. 
        Our understanding of energy conservation (and conserved quantities in general) will be deepened
        by considering solutions to Newton's Equations in this matter.
      </p>

      <hr/><h3>Generalizing to N-Dimensional Functions</h3>
      <p>Notice, too, that this formulation is not limited to 3-dimensional vectors. For all flat coordinate
        systems (that is, $\Bbb{R}^k\ \text{for}\ k \in \Bbb{N}$), (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2) can be generalized:
         </p>
      
         $$\vect{G} =\begin{bmatrix} x_1(t)\\ x_2(t)\\ x_3(t)\\ \vdots\\ x_k(t) \end{bmatrix}\ \text{and}\ \ 
         | \vect{G}| = \sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^{k} x_k(t)} \tag{Eq. 5}$$
      <p class ="eqcomment" style="text-align:center; font-size:10pt;"><b>Eq. 5</b> - Generalizations 
       of (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2), s.t. $\text{dim} \vect{G} = k$</p>
      <p>Why would we even care about generalizing a system beyond the 3-dimensional coordiante system?
        <ul><li>Dimensionality does not always have to denote <i>spatial dimensionality</i>.</li>
        <li>Think of lists or arrays in programming: their dimension corresponds to their size, and sometimes this 
          size may be quite large, dynamic, random, etc. </li>
        <li>Even when approaching problems <i>in</i> our 3D space, generalized coordinates prove useful. In a system of N-many particles, 
        we can denote different quantities $x_k$ for each particle, resulting in <i>k</i>-many dimensions to our system.</li>

    <p>
      Let us start by defining a full differential element for $\vect{r}$ to describe arbitrarily small changes:
    </p>
    <ul><li><i>Newton's dot notation</i>: let $\ddot{g}(t) \rightarrow \ddot{g}$. We do not want to keep redeclaring the time-dependence of our functions.</li>
    <li>We should be thorough and apply the product rule to each component of $\vect{r}$ to prove that calculus operations
       behave analogously to our one-dimensional cases. That is, let us invoke the right-hand-side of (Eq. 1).
    </li>
  <li>Recall that $\hata{x}$ is the unit vector for the x-direction. Unit vectors encode purely directional information.</li></ul>
    $$\begin{align*} 
    
    d \vect{r} &= d(\hata{x} x + \hata{y} y + \hata{z} z) \\
              &= d(\hata{x} x) + d(\hata{y} y) + d(\hata{z} z) \\
              &= \hata{x} dx  + x \cancel{d \hata{x}} + \hata{y} dy  + 
              y \cancel{d \hata{y}} + \hata{z} dz  + z \cancel{d \hata{z}} \\
              d \vect{r} &= \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{ \hata{x} dx  + \hata{y} dy + \hata{z} dz}
  
    \end{align*}$$
<p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 6</b> - Differentiating our cartesian unit vectors results in 0 as they are always constant. While this may seem obvious that differentiating $d \vect{r}$ produces $dx, dy, dz$ with unchanged magnitudes, 
other coordinate systems do not have such obvious differential elements. </p>
      <!--$$ \begin{align} 
      \vect{F} &= m \frac{dv}{dt} \\
      &= m \frac{d \vect{v}}{d \vect{x}} \cancelto{v(t)}{\frac{dx}{dt}} \\
      &= m \frac{d\vect{v}}{dx} \vect{v(t)} \\
      &= m \frac{d\vect{v}}{dx} \frac{d ( \frac{\vect{v}^2}{2})}{d\vect{v}} \\
      \vect{F} 
      &= \frac{1}{2} m \frac{d}{dx} \left[\vect{v}^2\right]
      \end{align} \tag{Eq. 1}$$ -->

<p>We are ready to reorganize Newton's Equation into a conservation statement. 
  Taking the dot product of our force field $\vect{F}$
  with our differential element $d \vect{r}$ produces:
