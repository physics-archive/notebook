      <p> 
        Transitioning our picture from $x(t) \rightarrow \vect{r}(t)$: the following will serve as a brief overview 
        on vector-valued functions. There are many equivalent ways of expressing vectors, and so it 
        is advantageous to cover a more than one when introducing the topic. 
        
        <br/><br/>In $\vect{r}$, we have a weighted sum of three standard basis vectors which
        correspond to position in the <i>x,y,z</i> directions:
      </p>
    $$ \bbox[8px,border:0px solid black] {\vect{r}(t) = 
    \hat{ \mathrm{ \boldsymbol{r}}} \mathrm{r}(t)  =

    \end{bmatrix} = 
    x(t) \vecta{1}{0}{0} + 
    y(t) \vecta{0}{1}{0} +
    z(t) \vecta{0}{0}{1} } \tag{Eq. 1}$$

    <p class="eqcomment"><b>Eq. 1</b> - A vector in $\Bbb{R}^3$ measured from the origin (0, 0, 0).

    <p>Since our $\vect{r}$ exists in flat space, then the magnitude of our vector
       is the pythagorean sum of its elements: </p>
      
      $$\bbox[8px,border:0px solid black]{ |\vect{r}(t)| = \sqrt{\vect{r} \cdot \vect{r}} = x(t) \oplus y(t) \oplus z(t) = \sqrt{[x(t)]^2+[y(t)]^2+[z(t)]^2}} \tag{Eq. 2} $$
    <p>Notice, our radicand is <i>not</i> a sum of vector-valued quantities; $x, y, z$ are scalar functions of <i>t</i>. 
      Operating on these scalar functions with the unit-vectors ($\hata{x}, \hata{y}, \hata{z}$) results in $\vect{r}$'s directional information.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Introducing our calculus operations: differentiating $\vect{r}$ with respect to time will simply apply the <i>scalar</i> operation to each

      <p>Notice, too, that this formulation is not limited to 3-vectors. For any choice of $\Bbb{R}^k $ ($k \in \Bbb{N}$),

        When approaching problems <i>in</i> our flat, 3-D space, generalized coordinates are invaluable. In a system of N-many particles, 
        we can denote different coordinates $x_k$ for each particle, resulting in <i>k</i>-many, coupled equations of motion.
