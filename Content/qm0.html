<p>Quantum mechanics is an abrupt shift in interpretation from our classical models. In Schr&ouml;dinger's model
  for particle mechanics, the function describing classical position $x(t)$ is replaced with
  a statistical object that we call the wavefunction $ \Psi(x,t)$. 
</p>  
<!--Later, we will return to closely
examine $\Psi$ and its perplexing properties from the beginning.
Consider this page a motivating preface to a volume on early Quantum Particle Mechanics.
</p>-->
  <!--Let us motivate a study into quantum mechanics by showcasing a
  directly-observable consequence of the wavefunction $\Psi$.-->

<ul id="introlist"><li><b>In Classical Mechanics</b>: <i>a particle's dynamics are completely described by 
its position $x(t)$ over time <i>t</i>. Solves a second-order <u>ordinary</u> differential equation</i>.</li>
<li><b>In Schr&ouml;dinger's Quantum Mechanics</b>: <i>information about a particle system is encoded 
 in a probability wavefunction, $\Psi(x,t)$, which spreads across space and evolves in time. Solves a linear <u>partial</u> differential equation</i>.</li></ul>
<hr/><h3 id="section">Motion in Newtonian Mechanics</h3>

<p>To understand how $\Psi(x,t)$ encodes observable information, like particle position, we should start by describing 
 classical motion. In Newton's formulation, a particle's
  position in three-dimensional space ($\vect{r}$) is described by the differential equation:
</p>
<p>$$ \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black] {\vect{F}= \frac{d\vect{p}}{dt} = m \frac{d^2\vect{r}}{dt^2}} \tag{Eq. 1}$$ 
</p>
<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 1</b> - Newton's equation of motion states that acceleration is the second
time-derivative of system position. If a system's mass is non-constant, <i>m</i> is not a scalar.</p>

<p>Solutions to (Eq. 1) will describe a system's motion exactly for all time and space; this is a deterministic model for motion. 
This ordinary differential equation (ODE) leads to the well-known relationships between $x(t)$ $v(t)$ and $a(t)$:</p>
$$ \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black] {a(t) = \frac{d v(t)}{dt} = \frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2}}$$

<!--<p>Since Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation is an energy conservation equation, let change (Eq. 1) using 
  calculus' chain rule so that it too is a statement about energy conservation. Reacll that $\ddot{x}$ is
  the first time-derivative of velocity:
</p>

$$ \begin{align} 
\vec{F} &= m \frac{dv}{dt} \\
&= m \frac{dv}{dx} \cancelto{v(t)}{\frac{dx}{dt}} \\
&= m \frac{dv}{dx} v(t) \\
&= m \frac{dv}{dx} \frac{d ( \frac{v^2}{2})}{dv} \\
\vec{F} 
&= \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{ \frac{1}{2} m \frac{d}{dx} \left[v^2\right]}
\end{align}$$-->




<hr/><h3>Motion and Energy in Schr&ouml;dinger's Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<p>Schr&ouml;dinger's analog to Newton's Equation is a complex-valued energy conservation equation:</p>

$$
\bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{
  i \hbar \frac{\partial{\Psi(x,t)}}{\partial{t}} = - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x,t) \Psi(x,t)
} \tag{Eq. 2}
$$
<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 2</b> - Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation for the energy and motion of a particle. Partial differential equation whose solutions are functions of both position and time: $\Psi(x,t)$.</p>

<p>This is a linear, second-order, partial differential equation, with a similar form to
  the wave equation. Obtaining analytical solutions to this PDE 
  for a given system potential, $V(x,t)$, is almost never trivial and often it is impossible. 
  
</p>
<hr/><h3 id="secheader">Where is Classical Position Encoded in Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation?</h3>

<p>Schr&ouml;dinger's Equation seems bizarre compared to Newton's; solutions ($\Psi$) are fields, 
  from which observable quantities may be extrapolated. 
  while the latter uses a simple, three-dimensional vector ($\vect{r}$). 
  
  <br/><br/>
If classical mechanics successfully predicts behavior of
many [mainly macroscopic] systems, then those results should fall out 
of quantum-mechanical models as well. That is, these equations <u>must</u> agree 
within classical limits of systems accurately described by classical models.
<ul id="introlist"><li>In other words, we need to verify that classical mechanics 
 is an approximation for quantum mechanics.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Schr&ouml;dinger's equation
  has solutions not of $x(t)$, but of a wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$. The square-amplitude of $\Psi$ is related to $x(t)$ 
  statistically (Gasiorowicz, pp. 46):
</p>
<span>
  $$
  \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{ \lt x \gt = \int_{- \infty}^{+ \infty} \left[\Psi^* \hat{x}\ \Psi \right]\ dx} \tag{Eq. 3}$$ 
</span>

<p id="eqnote"><b>Eq. 3</b> - Expectation value for position as a function of time. 
  Here, $\Psi^*(x,t)$ denotes the complex conjugate of $\Psi(x,t)$.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, $ \hat{x}$ 
  is an operator; $\hat{x}$ represents the operator for position. Operating on $\Psi$ with functional operators produces expectation values of physically significant quantites,
  such as momentum and position. 
<!--<br/><br/>Operator algebra and commutivity starts to play a crucial role in understanding the mathematics of 
physics, leading to a "type of math" that is entirely absent from undergraduate-level classical mechanics. -->
  
<ul><li>The wavefunction is not directly observable, yet its probability density (|$\Psi^2$|) is physically significant and
  <a class="link" href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.213001" target="_blank">may be imaged</a> with very modern technology.</li></ul>
  
  <ul>
    
    <!--<li>This is a bizarre way of describing a system's motion; it is highly indirect in comparison to classical mechanics,
which has solutions to its diff. eq. that are directly observable $x(t)$.</li> -->
<li>Here, $\lt x(t) \gt$ is the probability of finding our particle between $- \infty$ and $+ \infty$ (entire <i>x</i>-axis). This boundary may be finite, and 
  (Eq. 3) must be a convergent integral if it is to meaningfully describe observable quantities (Gasiorowicz, pp. 48).</li></ul></p>
