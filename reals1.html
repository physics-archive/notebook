<h2 style="text-align:center">Resolving Paradoxes in the Real Number Set $\Bbb{R}$<br/><span id="comment">Page is under heavy development and is incomplete</span></h2>


<p>Let us motivate some analysis of the real number line and its properties. In this section, I aim to demonstrate the following:</p>

<ul id="introlist">
  <li>Paradoxes in our real number line are numerous, clearly demonstrable, and 
    require resolution using set theory</li>
    <li>Extending our number system from the naturals through to the reals ($\Bbb{N} \subseteq \Bbb{Z} \subseteq \Bbb{Q} \subseteq \Bbb{R}$) is required if 
      every length along the number line is to correspond to a value that we can actually define <span style="font-size:13pt">(Abbott, 2000 pg. 4)</span>.</li>
    <li>Functions may be generalized to a definition that is much less strict than what is covered prior to Real Analysis. This is instrumental in Physics, as it allows for numerical techniques (via computer) to be carried out when analytical solutions do not exist, which is often.</li>
    <li>Computational methods and resources have value even when approaching pure mathematics</li>
</ul><!--Ends intro list-->


<p id="intro">Consider this bizarre function proposed by Dirichlet:</p>

<span>$$

f(x) = \begin{cases} 
1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \\
0\ \ \text{if} \ x \notin \Bbb{Q}

\end{cases} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</span> <!--Cases-->

<p>Plotting this function over the real number line $\Bbb{R}$ produces a figure that prompts discussion about 
  continuity, and more generally into the "fine structure" of $\Bbb{R}$. The plot conflicts with our limited definition of functions
$(f)$ leading up to this point, as it cannot be expressed as an algebraic relationship and seems to test the borders of being single-valued.</p>

</div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 1.</b> - A plot of f(x). This is a single function, coded numerically in MATLAB; it is not two functions stacked on top one another.</span>
<p>Here are some important observation about the properties of $f(x)$:
<ul><li>The irrational numbers (when $x \notin \Bbb{Q}$) are constructed from the "holes" in the rational number line above it, at $f(x)=1$.
  Is there a symmetry or some sort of pattern to this extreme discontinuity?<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>This is a loose way of visualizing the property that elements of $\Bbb{Q}$ are dense in $\Bbb{R}$</li></ul>
<ul><li>Paradoxically, both sets of points consist of infinitely-many elements, no matter our scope along $\Bbb{R}$. We must look
  into real analysis to compare infinite sets. This property of a number set is called cardinality.
</li></ul>

</p>
<hr/><h3>Further Visualizing $\Bbb{Q}$'s Density in $\Bbb{R}$</h3>
<p>An interesting way to show that $\Bbb{Q}$ has density, as opposed to its subsets $\Bbb{N}$ and $\Bbb{Z}$,
  is to plot an analogue to Dirichlet's function using the integers. This time, the empty intervals between the upper set of points ($\Bbb{Z}$) 
  will be filled by the rationals of $\Bbb{Q}$ -- analogous to (Fig. 1) where the holes of $\Bbb{Q}$ were filled by the irrationals:</p>
  
  <span id="z">$$

    f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x) = \begin{cases} 
    1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Z} \\
    0\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \land x \notin \Bbb{Z}
    
    \end{cases} \tag{Eq. 2}$$</span>

<div id="fig2">
<img src=".\MATLAB\int-intervals.png" height="210px" width="285px" /></div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 2.</b> - A plot of $f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x)$ over a 
  domain that demonstrates how 
  empty intervals in $\Bbb{Z}$ are filled by densely-packed rationals. 
  Notice that irrationals are omitted in (Eq. 2) from the second piecewise condition, yet the number set at $f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x)=0$ still looks like a continuum; it is not a continuum as it is missing the irrationals.</span>

  <p>This property of $\Bbb{Q}$ to appear continuous, regardless of domain scope, is why the rational numbers form a field and support the identities for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction.
    Not every element of $\Bbb{Z}$ has the multiplication inverses to support division, for example. Still, we are missing many numbers in (Fig. 2) such as factors of $\pi$ or $\sqrt{2}$.
  </p>
<!--<p>This points towards the rational set being undoubtably "bigger" than the integer set. However, this is untrue. 
  Cardinality and equinumerosity give us the result that $\Bbb{Z}$ and $\Bbb{Q}$ actually have the same number of elements as each other and $\Bbb{N}$.</p>
<ul><li>In fact, it's even less intuitive. If |$\Bbb{Z}$| denotes the cardinatlity (# of elements) in the integer set $\Bbb{Z}$, 
  then it is fact that:</li></ul>

  <span>

    $$

    |\Bbb{N}|=|\Bbb{Z}|=|\Bbb{Q}|=\aleph_0 \tag{Eq. 3} $$
  </span>

  <span>Using real analysis, we can arrive at this conclusion by showing that each set can be bijectively mapped onto any of the three.
