<h2 style="text-align:center">Resolving Paradoxes in the Real Number Set $\Bbb{R}$<br/><span id="comment">Page is under heavy development and is incomplete</span></h2>


<p>Let us motivate some analysis of the real number line and its properties. In this section, I aim to demonstrate the following:</p>

<ul id="introlist">
  <li>Paradoxes in our real number line are numerous, clearly demonstrable, and 
    require resolution using set theory</li>
    <li>Functions may be generalized to a definition that is much less strict than what is covered prior to Real Analysis</li>
    <li>Computational methods and resources have value even when approaching pure mathematics</li>
    <li>Differences between the sets of Natural Numbers ($\Bbb{N}$), Integers ($\Bbb{Z}$), Rationals ($\Bbb{Q}$) and Reals ($\Bbb{R}$)
      are worth considering
    </li>
    <li>Extending our number system from the naturals through to the reals ($\Bbb{N} \subseteq \Bbb{Z} \subseteq \Bbb{Q} \subseteq \Bbb{R}$) is required to enable every operation [<i>incomplete line</i>]</li>
</ul><!--Ends intro list-->


<p id="intro">Consider this bizarre function proposed by Dirichlet:</p>

<span>$$

f(x) = \begin{cases} 
1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \\
0\ \ \text{if} \ x \notin \Bbb{Q}

\end{cases} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</span> <!--Cases-->

<p>Plotting this function over the real number line $\Bbb{R}$ produces a figure that prompts discussion about 
  continuity, and more generally into the "fine structure" of $\Bbb{R}$. The plot conflicts with our limited definition of functions
$(f)$ leading up to this point, as it cannot be expressed as an algebraic relationship and seems to test the borders of being single-valued.</p>

<div id="fig1">
<img src=".\MATLAB\dirichlet.png" height="210px" width="285px" />
</div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 1.</b> - A plot of f(x). This is a single function, not two stacked on top of each other. The elements of the lower 
  line (irrational numbers) are located where the holes in the above line ($\Bbb{Q}$) are located.</span>
<p>Plotting this function over $\Bbb{R}$ is deceptive to the unexpectant observer because it appears only
  to violate our conditions for an ordinary function: it does not look single-valued. However, (Eq. 1) defines a clear
  rule that guarantees it is a valid function. 
<ul><li>The irrational numbers (when $x \notin \Bbb{Q}$) are constructed from the "holes" in the rational number line above it, at $f(x)=1$.
  Is there a symmetry or some sort of pattern to this extreme discontinuity?<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>This is a loose way of visualizing the property that elements of $\Bbb{Q}$ are dense in $\Bbb{R}$</li></ul>
<ul><li>Problem: both sets of points consist of innfinitely-many values, no matter the interval size. Once again, we must look deeper
  into real analysis to resolve a paradox of comparing objects of infinite size. This property of a number set is called cardinality.
</li></ul>

</p>

<p>An interesting way to show that $\Bbb{Q}$ is different from its subsets $\Bbb{N}$ and $\Bbb{Z}$ with regards to continuity
  is to create an analogue to Dirichlet's function with the integers. This time, the empty intervals between the integers of $\Bbb{Z}$ 
  will be filled by the rationals of $\Bbb{Q}$:</p>
  
  <span id="z">$$

    f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x) = \begin{cases} 
    1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Z} \\
    0\ \ \text{if} \ x \notin \Bbb{Z}
    
    \end{cases} \tag{Eq. 2}$$</span>

<div id="fig2">
<img src=".\MATLAB\int-intervals.png" height="210px" width="285px" /></div>
<span id="fignotes"><b>Fig 2.</b> - A plot of $f_{\Bbb{Z}}(x)$ over a 
  domain that is convenient for visualizing the 
  empty intervals in $\Bbb{Z}$. 
  These intervals are filled by densely-packed rationals.</span>

<p>This points towards the rational set being undoubtably "bigger" than the integer set. However, this is untrue. 
  Cardinality and equinumerosity give us the result that $\Bbb{Z}$ and $\Bbb{Q}$ actually have the same number of elements.</p>
<ul><li>In fact, it's even less intuitive. If |$\Bbb{Z}$| denotes the cardinatlity (# of elements) in the integer set $\Bbb{Z}$, 
  then it is fact that:</li></ul>

  <span>

    $$

    |\Bbb{N}|=|\Bbb{Z}|=|\Bbb{Q}|=\aleph_0 \tag{Eq. 3} $$
  </span>

  <span>Using real analysis, we can arrive at this conclusion by showing that each set can be bijectively mapped onto any of the three.
