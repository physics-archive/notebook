<h2 style="text-align:center">Resolving Paradoxes in the Real Number Set $\Bbb{R}$</h2>

<p id="intro">Consider this bizarre function proposed by Dirichlet:</p>

<span>$$

f(x) = \begin{cases} 
1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Q} \\
0\ \ \text{if} \ x \notin \Bbb{Q}

\end{cases} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</span> <!--Cases-->

<p>Plotting this function over the real number line $\Bbb{R}$ produces a paradoxical result that motivates a 
  deeper study into continuity, and more generally into the fine structures of $\Bbb{Q}$ and $\Bbb{R}$ themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>Plotting this function over $\Bbb{R}$ is deceptive to the unexpectant observer because it appears only
  to violate our conditions for an ordinary function: it does not look single-valued. However, (Eq. 1) defines a clear
  rule that guarantees it is a valid function. 
<ul><li>The irrational numbers (when $x \notin \Bbb{Q}$) are constructed from the "holes" in the rational number line above it, at $f(x)=1$.
  Is there a symmetry or some sort of pattern to this extreme discontinuity?<br/>
</li>
<li>Problem: both sets of points consist of innfinitely-many values, even on the interval [0,1]. Once again, we must look deeper
  into analysis to resolve this paradox of comparing objects of infinite size.
</li>
<li>This is a loose way of visualizing the property that $\Bbb{Q}$ is dense in $\Bbb{R}$</li></ul>
</p>

<p>An interesting way to show that $\Bbb{Q}$ as a field is different from its subsets $\Bbb{N}$ and $\Bbb{Z}$ 
  is to create an analogue to Dirichlet's function with one of those subsets insetead:</p>
  
  <span id="z">$$

    f(x) = \begin{cases} 
    1\ \ \text{if} \ x \in \Bbb{Z} \\
    0\ \ \text{if} \ x \notin \Bbb{Z}
    
    \end{cases} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</span>
