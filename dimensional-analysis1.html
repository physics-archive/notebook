<h1 id="header">Dimensional Analysis and Limiting Conditions</h1>

<div id="intro">

  <p>Here's a powerful tool to demonstrate why theoretical physics is an effective approach when modeling physical systems. 
    Using dimensional and numerical analysis, let us determine the exact form for a pendulum's cycle frequency. 
    Physical observation will our mathematical logic, and vise versa.</p>
  
  <p>Starting with physics -- what real-world parameters determine the pendulum frequnecy $f$? 
    Mathematically I am asking: what is $f$ actually a function of in our isolated system? Here are some realistic possibilities:
    <ul id="list1">
      <li>Gravitational acceleration ($g$)</li>
      <li>Length ($L$) of the pendulum</li>
      <li>Mass ($m$) of the pendulum</li>
      <!--<li>Initial angle ($ \theta_i$) of the pendulum</li>-->
    </ul>
    <p>Conveniently, all quantities except for $ \theta$ are dimensional. Therefore, whatever form $f( \ell,g,m, \theta_i)$ takes on,
      it must be dimensionally valid. Not all proposals for $f$ make sense, and so we can start to make some deductions.
    </p>

    <p>Let me express this proposed relationship for $f$ as an algebraic function of those parameters:</p>
    
    <p>$$ f\left( \ell,g,m \right)\ \text{~}\ \ell^{ \alpha} g^{ \beta} m^{ \gamma} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</p>
    <p>Here, $\alpha, \beta,$ and $\gamma$ are entirely unknown -- they might even be zero. We require a system of equations
      to make any determinations. There are three unknowns and three dimensions, so we may be in luck.
       <br/><br/>Since $f$ has units of frequency ($T^{-1}$), then
      the quantity $\ell^{ \alpha} g^{ \beta} m^{ \gamma}$ 
      must also have units of frequency. This allows us to transform our statement so that we equate the dimensionality
      of our relationship, thus producing multiple equations for our multiple dimensions:
    </p>
    
    <span>$$ \begin{align*}
      T^{-1}
      &=L^{ \alpha} \left( L T^{-2}\right)^{ \beta} M^{ \gamma}\\
      &= L^{ \alpha} L^{ \beta} T^{-2 \beta} M^{ \gamma}\\ 
      L^0 T^{-1} M^0 &= L^{( \alpha + \beta)} T^{-2 \beta} M^{ \gamma}
      \end{align*} \tag{Eq. 2}$$</span>
    
      <span>We obtain three equations from this - one for each dimension that nature inevitably balances. 
        For instance, to balance out our dimensions of mass, there is only one possibility for $ \gamma$: 
      </span>
    $$\begin{align} M^{ \gamma} = 1\\ \gamma = 0 \end{align} \tag{Eq. 3}$$

    <span>Clearly, $ \gamma = 0$ is the only way to make $M^{ \gamma}=1$. So, $f$ cannot depend on the pendulum's mass.<br/><br/>
      This type of quantitative deduction is at the core of dimensional analysis. Let us clean this up and actually write-out the
      system of equations, and then represent it as a matrix:
    </span>

    <!--make this into a list i.e. math: function, physics: parameters.-->
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <!--<p>Once we begin studying classical mechanics theoretically, familiarizing ourselves with the underlying mathematics becomes a serious priority.
    The rigor of our approach intensifies in pursuit of obtaining exact solutions. 
    We can revisit trivial problems to answer them more generally and with greater elegance. 
    More importantly, we can expand deeply on Newton's equations in order to determine the motion of systems that were previously unsolvable.</p>

    <p>Physical quantities are often dimensional (assigned a unit).
        This is important because it limits our math statements, just like with code. I.e. adding some velocity to a voltage is nonsense--if we find ourselves performing this operation on a problem, we have made a mistake.
        <br/><br/>So, dimensional analysis is good for fact-checking our math. What else?
                It enables us to determine the forms of function, given no information about the system outside of obvious deductions. Physical logic and observation determines our mathematical logic, and vise versa. Therefore, let us made a set of basic observations about a pendulum, and then determine the analytical expression for its cycle frequency $f$.
