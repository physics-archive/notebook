<div id="intro">

  <p>Here's a powerful tool to demonstrate why theoretical physics is an effective approach when modeling physical systems. 
    I aim to showcase the advantages of working with dimensional units when performing quantitative analysis. Dimension refers to a quantity's unit of measurement (i.e. the quantity $2 meters$ has dimensions of: length $L^1$.
    </p>
    <ul id="listb">
      <li>We can verify our work in physics by checking for balanced
        units in our quantitative relationships. This is invaluable in experimental physics, since your own computations via programming
        are dimensionless; the researcher must interpret the results, and code the dimensionally-correct calculations. 
        Even raw data are stored as dimensionless number sets.
      </li>
      <li>We will explore extreme cases of system parameters - i.e. infinite mass, zero gravity - as a means
        of verifying that our <i>mathematical</i> results make <i>physical</i> sense.
      </li>
      <li>Deeper than that: we can find physical relationships in real systems using
        unit-balancing as our rationale for constraining variables.
      </li>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Case I: The Pendulum</h2>
    Using dimensional analysis and basic linear algebra, let us determine the exact form for a pendulum's cycle frequency. 
    Physical observation will our mathematical logic, and vise versa.</p>
  
  <p>Starting with physics -- what real-world parameters determine the pendulum frequnecy $f$? 
    Mathematically I am asking: what is $f$ actually a function of in our isolated system? Here are some realistic possibilities:</p>
    
    <img src="./Index/theoretical/pendulum2.png" height="120px" width="80px" style="float:right; padding-right:70px;"/>

    <ul id="list1">
      <li>Gravitational acceleration ($g$)</li>
      <li>Length ($ \ell $) of the pendulum</li>
      <li>Mass ($m$) of the pendulum</li>
      <li>Initial angle $\theta_i$</li>
      <!--<li>Initial angle ($ \theta_i$) of the pendulum</li>-->
    </ul>
    
    
    <p><br/>Conveniently, all quantities except for $ \theta$ are dimensional. Whatever form $f( \ell,g,m, \theta_i)$ takes on,
      it must be dimensionally valid. Not all proposals for $f$ make sense, and so we can start to make some deductions.
      For $\theta_i$, we will provide justification for considering its contribution as functional $\theta_i \rightarrow \Theta(\theta_i)$
    </p>

    <p>Let me express this proposed relationship for $f$ as an algebraic function of those parameters:</p>
    
    <p>$$ f\left( \ell,g,m \right)\ \text{~}\ \ell^{ \alpha} g^{ \beta} m^{ \gamma} \tag{Eq. 1}$$</p>
    <p>Here, $\alpha, \beta,$ and $\gamma$ are entirely unknown -- they might even be zero. We require a system of equations
      to make any determinations. There are three unknowns and three dimensions, so we may be in luck.
       <br/><br/>Since $f$ has units of frequency ($T^{-1}$), then
      the quantity $\ell^{ \alpha} g^{ \beta} m^{ \gamma}$ 
      must also have units of frequency. This allows us to transform our statement so that we equate the dimensionality
      of our relationship, thus producing multiple equations for our multiple dimensions:
    </p>
    
    <span>$$ \begin{align*}
      T^{-1}
      &=L^{ \alpha} \left( L T^{-2}\right)^{ \beta} M^{ \gamma}\\
      &= L^{ \alpha} L^{ \beta} T^{-2 \beta} M^{ \gamma}\\ 
      L^0 T^{-1} M^0 &= L^{( \alpha + \beta)} T^{-2 \beta} M^{ \gamma}
      \end{align*} \tag{Eq. 2}$$</span>
    
      <span>We obtain three equations from this - one for each dimension that nature inevitably balances. 
        For instance, to balance out our dimensions of mass, there is only one possibility for $ \gamma$: 
      </span>
    $$\begin{align} M^{ \gamma} = 1\\ \gamma = 0 \end{align} \tag{Eq. 3}$$

    <span>Clearly, $ \gamma = 0$ is the only way to make $M^{ \gamma}=1$. So, $f$ cannot depend on the pendulum's mass.<br/><br/>
      This type of quantitative deduction is at the core of dimensional analysis. 
      We eliminated mass as a variable in pendulum frequency through pure mathematical reasoning. 
      Now, let us clean this up and actually write-out the
      system of equations, and then represent it as a matrix:
    </span>

    <p class="system">
      $$ \begin{cases}
      1 \alpha + 1 \beta + 0 \gamma = 0 \\
      0 \alpha -2 \beta + 0 \gamma= -1 \\
      0 \alpha + 0 \beta + 1 \gamma = 0 \end{cases}$$  
    </p>

    <p>Joining both sides of (Eq. 3) to form a 3x4 matrix, we can row-reduce that object to obtain $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$:
    </p>

    <span id="matrix1">$$
      \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & -2 & 0 & -1\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0
      \end{bmatrix} \stackrel{rr}{ \rightarrow} 
  \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 & 1/2\\
  0 & 1 & 0 & -1/2\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0
     \end{bmatrix} $$
    </span>
    <p class="ans">
      $$ \begin{cases}
      \alpha = \frac{1}{2}\\
      \beta = - \frac{1}{2} \\
      \gamma = 0 \end{cases}$$  
    </p>
    
    <p>These exponents produce the following frequency relationship for our pendulum:</p>

    $$f(g, \ell)\ \text{~}\ \sqrt{ \frac{g}{ \ell}} \tag{Eq. 4}$$
    <p>This result states that the frequency of a pendulum scales with the square-root of gravitational acceleration, 
    and with the inverse square-root of pendulum length. 
    Mass did not factor into $f( \ell, g)$.</p>

    <p>Writing this as an equality rather than a dependency relationship will require us to 
      address any dimensionless constants that would not have been encoded in the dimensionality of $f$.
      Values like $\pi$ or $1/2$ may appear, and we know that some function of our initial angle $\theta_i$ probably
    contributes to $f$ since $\theta_i = 0$ should give us $f = 0$, and $theta_i = 90^0$ probably gives us $f_max$<br/><br/>
  Therefore, we transform (Eq. 4) into an equality by including some unknown function ($\Theta$) of intial-angle:</p>

  $$ \bbox[8px,border:1px solid black]{f(\ell, g, \theta_i) = \Theta(\theta_i) \sqrt{ \frac{g}{ \ell}}} 
  \tag{Eq. 5}$$

<p>We can plot and algebraically evaluate these relationships for $g$ and $l$ to convince 
  ourselves that our expression makes sense.</p>
<ul id="list1">
  <li>Decreasing $g$ should decrease $f$, since gravity is our only source of acceleration / motion.</li>
  <li>Intuitively, effects of changing $ \ell$ are less clear, so (Eq. 5) proves insightful.</li>
</ul>

<div id="imgpair">
<img src="./Index/theoretical/pendulum_g.bmp" height="150px;" width="220px;"/>
<img src="./Index/theoretical/pendulum_l.bmp" height="150px;" width="220px;"/>
</div>

<p>Our limiting cases for system parameters also demonstrates that (Eq. 5) makes physical sense:</p>
  
$$ \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty} f( \ell) = \Theta \ \lim_{l \rightarrow \infty}  \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}} = 0 \tag{Lim. 1}$$
<p style="text-align:center; font-size:12pt;"><b>Lim. 1</b> - If $a \gt \gt b$ in a number ($a/b$), then ($a/b) \rightarrow 0$.</p>
$$ \lim_{g \rightarrow 0} f(g) = \Theta \ \lim_{g \rightarrow \infty}  \sqrt{\frac{g}{l}} = 0 \tag{Lim. 2}$$

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:12pt;"><b>Lim. 2</b> - Zero gravity gives us no pendulum motion, as expected.</p>

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <!--<p>Once we begin studying classical mechanics theoretically, familiarizing ourselves with the underlying mathematics becomes a serious priority.
    The rigor of our approach intensifies in pursuit of obtaining exact solutions. 
    We can revisit trivial problems to answer them more generally and with greater elegance. 
    More importantly, we can expand deeply on Newton's equations in order to determine the motion of systems that were previously unsolvable.</p>

    <p>Physical quantities are often dimensional (assigned a unit).
        This is important because it limits our math statements, just like with code. I.e. adding some velocity to a voltage is nonsense--if we find ourselves performing this operation on a problem, we have made a mistake.
        <br/><br/>So, dimensional analysis is good for fact-checking our math. What else?
                It enables us to determine the forms of function, given no information about the system outside of obvious deductions. Physical logic and observation determines our mathematical logic, and vise versa. Therefore, let us made a set of basic observations about a pendulum, and then determine the analytical expression for its cycle frequency $f$.
