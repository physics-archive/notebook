  <p>Here's a powerful tool to demonstrate why theoretical physics is an effective approach when modeling physical systems. Using dimensional and numerical analysis, let us determine the exact form for a pendulum's cycle frequency. Physical observation guides our mathematical logic, and vise versa.</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <!--<p>Once we begin studying classical mechanics theoretically, familiarizing ourselves with the underlying mathematics becomes a serious priority.
    The rigor of our approach intensifies in pursuit of obtaining exact solutions. 
    We can revisit trivial problems to answer them more generally and with greater elegance. 
    More importantly, we can expand deeply on Newton's equations in order to determine the motion of systems that were previously unsolvable.</p>

    <p>Physical quantities are often dimensional (assigned a unit).
        This is important because it limits our math statements, just like with code. I.e. adding some velocity to a voltage is nonsense--if we find ourselves performing this operation on a problem, we have made a mistake.
        <br/><br/>So, dimensional analysis is good for fact-checking our math. What else?
                It enables us to determine the forms of function, given no information about the system outside of obvious deductions. Physical logic and observation determines our mathematical logic, and vise versa. Therefore, let us made a set of basic observations about a pendulum, and then determine the analytical expression for its cycle frequency $f$.
